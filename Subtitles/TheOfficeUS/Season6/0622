1
00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:03,726
<i>Oscar, Toby said
he left my girl scout cookies</i>

2
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:06,053
<i>on my chair.
Have you seen them?</i>

3
00:00:06,178 --> 00:00:08,165
<i>Wait, I'm sitting on them.</i>

4
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:09,606
This is awesome.

5
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:11,677
Thank you.
It didn't even take that long.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,416
<i>What's the difference
between a chimichanga,</i>

7
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,778
<i>a chalupa,</i>

8
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:17,183
<i> and a tostada?</i>

9
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:19,826
<i>Call me back ASAP.</i>

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,496
<i>It's urgent.</i>

11
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:24,838
This isn't funny.

12
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:26,627
I don't talk like that.

13
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:28,586
Say, "Me eat cookie."

14
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:30,947
I won't say it.

14
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,665
Why is everyone clumped
around accounting?

15
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,801
Break it up, you clique.

16
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:35,524
It's Kevin as cookie monster

17
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:36,359
from Sesame Street.

18
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:37,872
Is that the program

19
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:39,010
where all those puppets
live in the barrio?

20
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,795
- Mm-hmm.
- I love that show.

21
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:43,069
This is Kevin. This is Kevin.

22
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:44,715
Thank you.

23
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:45,609
That is an amusing link.

24
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,437
I'd like it sent to me,
please. - Yes.

25
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,057
Me too, Oscar.
Please send it to me.

26
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:50,653
C.C. Me.

27
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:52,566
Angela, this is inappropriate.

28
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,317
This is my favorite day.

29
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:17,023
It's secretary's day.

30
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:21,107
And it is Erin's and my
three-week anniversary.

31
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:24,630
So perfect storm for
a romantic gesture.

32
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:27,401
Want to make sure the
whole office remembers

33
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:28,558
it's secretary's day.

34
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,163
I sent an email blast,
a text blast,

35
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:32,110
a good, old-fashioned talk blast.

36
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:34,280
I sent a snail mail
blast a week ago.

37
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:37,434
And a stern reminder via fax at 7:00
this morning,

38
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:38,916
so people better step up

39
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,647
and appreciate the
crap out of Erin.

40
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,192
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

41
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:44,151
I do.

42
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,212
Thank you.

43
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,243
If it wasn't for secretaries,

44
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:52,427
I wouldn't have a stepmom.

45
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:55,061
- Welcome back.
- Hey, thanks.

46
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:57,329
It's my first day back
after maternity leave.

47
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,809
And I miss Cece, of course.

48
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,133
But we need the money.

49
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,753
What was maternity leave like?

50
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:07,879
Oh, how do I explain it?
It rocked.

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,798
It rocked my ass off.

52
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:14,569
Oh. You couldn't have watered it?

53
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:16,987
I literally did not
know that existed

54
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:17,818
until this moment.

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,251
Well, I knew it existed,
and I chose to let it die.

56
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,264
It's nice to see
you again, Dwight.

57
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:25,377
Hello, Pam.

58
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,820
I was just wondering
what you had planned

59
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:28,736
for secretary's day.

60
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:30,092
I'm going to give Erin $15.

61
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:33,597
I know that Erin
would be so psyched

62
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:34,977
if you took her out to lunch.

63
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:37,079
- A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
- Yeah.

64
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,585
She really looks up to you.

65
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:40,794
And there's only so much
we can do as her coworkers.

66
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:44,717
Secretary's day is really kind
of a boss-secretary thing.

67
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,298
She's kind of a rube.

68
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:52,230
That's my girlfriend
you're talking about.

69
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:53,749
Okay. All right. All right.

70
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,067
Okay. I'll take her to lunch.

71
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:57,130
She's gonna be so psyched.

72
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,407
Hi, Erin.

73
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:00,562
Happy secretary's day.

74
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:01,623
Well, happy boss's day.

75
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:03,771
There wouldn't be a secretary
if there was no boss.

76
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:05,814
I wanted to know what
your plans for lunch were

77
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:07,962
because I was hoping
to ask you to...

78
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:09,927
Lunch.

79
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,981
I got a picture of
you asking me to lunch.

80
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,703
I was thinking we could
go to Hayworth's.

81
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,216
- Ugh.
- Just the two of us.

82
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:18,461
Well, Hayworth's is
more business casual,

83
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:20,294
and they always
screw up your order.

84
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:22,769
So I'm... - Yeah, okay.

85
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,384
Yeah, that was a
stupid suggestion.

86
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:25,879
I was thinking someplace special,

87
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,437
so I thought Hayworth's, but...

88
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:28,898
Okay, well,
we'll figure something.

89
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:29,725
Oh.

90
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,519
Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.

91
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,595
- Okay.
- All right.

92
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:37,706
Have a cookie, kev.

93
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,333
Yeah, ha ha. Tray of cookie.

94
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:41,737
I'm not falling for that.

95
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,184
I brought those in.

96
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:44,124
It's my birthday.

97
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,658
That's some stone-cold
narcissism right there.

98
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,380
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry.

99
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:51,846
Happy Birthday. - Thank you.

100
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,573
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

101
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,006
They're making fun
of cookie monster.

102
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:00,118
I get that.

103
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,091
But in a strange way, it feels

104
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:04,129
like they're making fun of me.

105
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:08,235
Oscar, did you eat
some of my m&m's?

106
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:10,906
The level-- - this is
violent and offensive.

107
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,052
Thank you.

108
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:15,323
It really make me
self-conscious about my voice.

109
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:18,849
- It's awful.
- I'm not crying.

110
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,971
You have some food on your face.

111
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:24,640
Do my hands feel sweaty to you?

112
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,811
The beginning here has been
a little bit of a fiasco.

113
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:30,581
Either they don't respect me
or they respect me too much.

114
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:33,416
And some of them still think
that I'm the I.T. Guy.

115
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:37,112
This cookie monster
thing is an opportunity

116
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:39,165
to show people that I'm
an authority figure.

117
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:43,604
Hello, everyone.

118
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:45,478
If I might have a
moment of your time.

119
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,350
It's come to my attention
that people have been watching

120
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,928
and laughing at a
hurtful parody video.

121
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:54,723
It is now forbidden to talk,
joke about,

122
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:55,719
or email this around.

123
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:57,385
Yeah.

124
00:04:57,386 --> 00:04:58,676
And that's straight
from corporate.

125
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:00,786
So, not to be scary,

126
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:02,527
but, yeah, I would listen to me.

127
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:03,574
And that's all.

128
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:05,198
Ciao.

129
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:15,382
Would you mind if I
listen to my book on tape?

130
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,249
I'm kind of a bookworm.

131
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:20,406
This is a novelization
of the movie

132
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:23,054
Based on the book push by sapphire.

133
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,753
I was thinking it would be
fun to talk on the way over.

134
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,855
So what decade would you
have chosen to be a teenager?

135
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:33,387
I don't know.

136
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:35,594
I would have chosen the 1490s.

137
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:38,634
'Cause America was discovered.

138
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:39,263
Right.

139
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:44,972
And then my last job was
at a taco bell express.

140
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,646
But then it became
a full taco bell,

141
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,480
and I don't know,
I couldn't keep up.

142
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,428
My favorite part about
being a receptionist

143
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:52,897
is that I get to have my own desk.

144
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:54,663
In my foster home,
I never had a desk.

145
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:58,194
So it's like--I don't mean that
I didn't like my foster home.

146
00:05:58,195 --> 00:05:59,235
I did like it.

147
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:00,797
I just didn't have a desk there.

148
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:01,894
Did you have a favorite age?

149
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,210
Or month?

150
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:06,826
An age or month?

151
00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:07,931
Yeah, like a favorite month.

152
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:10,107
Like, I like April
when I was seven.

153
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:12,315
I've been trying.
I've been trying

154
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:13,138
to keep it going.

155
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:19,152
Erin is just weird.

156
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:21,199
How many pillows do
you sleep on at night?

157
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,824
So how are things
going with Andy?

158
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,446
He's the best
boyfriend in the world.

159
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,850
Tell me about him
before I met him.

160
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:30,603
Well, let's see.

161
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:33,843
Um... Andy.

162
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:35,244
Plays the banjo.

163
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,941
Yeah. I love that.

164
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:39,454
Other than the fact
that he dated Angela,

165
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,846
I don't think he is
a snappy dresser.

166
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:43,726
What?

167
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:45,043
I don't think he
is the best dresser.

168
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:47,847
Reminds me of Easter.
Sorry. About Angela?

169
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,358
Did you say he dated Angela?

170
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:52,464
Mm-hmm.

171
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:53,750
You didn't know that?

172
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:55,839
Oh. - Here we go. Hot plate.

173
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,049
- Okay.
- And your salad, miss.

174
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,978
Why wouldn't he tell me that?

175
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,298
I don't know.

176
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,908
Probably didn't want you
to have a mental image

177
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,460
of him having sex
with somebody else.

178
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:08,449
They had sex?

179
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:10,322
They were engaged, so...

180
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:14,149
Okay. You know what, sir?

181
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:15,791
Yes.

182
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,296
Yeah, I asked for
pickles with my burger,

183
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:18,761
and there are only,
like, five or six.

184
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:19,864
Could I get some more pickles?

185
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,490
Of course. I'll get
you a bowl of pickles.

186
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,763
- Thank you.
- They were engaged?

187
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:26,161
Mm-hmm.

188
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,513
Yeah.

189
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,300
- Uh-oh.
- Well...

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,578
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

191
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:42,602
In the foster home,
my hair was my room.

192
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:50,564
Okay. You know what?

193
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:51,945
You know what? You know what?

194
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:53,145
Everybody's looking
at you right now.

195
00:07:58,152 --> 00:07:59,474
I'll have what she's having.

196
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,126
- Did you have a-
- did you like your lunch?

197
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,134
Did you have a good lunch?

198
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,886
Did you like that?
Did you enjoy your food?

199
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,429
It was good. I liked my lunch.

200
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:18,342
Ooh.

201
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:19,720
Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.

202
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:22,518
- What's up?
- Her milk is coming in.

203
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,426
She's getting uncomfortable.

204
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:24,698
Dwight, don't be gross.

205
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:25,968
No, no, he's right.

206
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:28,457
Same thing happens with my cows

207
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,854
if I don't tend them
frequently enough.

208
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,848
You gotta milk them,
or else they'll moo like crazy.

209
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:34,710
That's weird.
My breast pump is missing.

210
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:35,576
Have you seen my breast pump?

211
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:38,050
All right,
this is gonna traumatize me

212
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,216
a hell of a lot more than you,
believe me.

213
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:41,946
You know what, Dwight?

214
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,579
Let me just check
the bathroom first.

215
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,839
Okay? - Really? Fine.

216
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,964
Let your breasts explode.

217
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:49,598
Three squeezes and
I would drain you.

218
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,910
Mm.

219
00:08:54,803 --> 00:08:55,412
Meredith!

220
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:56,483
I just like the way it feels.

221
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:57,611
What are you doing?

222
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:59,122
- Relax. Okay.
- Relax?

223
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,212
This is like the
Cadillac of pumps.

224
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,275
Give it back to me now.

225
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,231
Okay, I was just warming it up.

226
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:05,681
It's disgusting!

227
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:07,771
- It's not a big deal.
- It's not sterile!

228
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:09,218
We're both girls. Who cares?

229
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,053
So...

230
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:26,615
How was lunch?

231
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:27,709
Lunch was fine.

232
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:31,759
Was it everything that you
hoped and dreamed it might be?

233
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,517
I don't know.
It was lunch, Andy.

234
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:37,331
Well, I know.

235
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:39,336
Just want-- I mean...

236
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:42,921
Erin?

237
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:44,735
I think we're out
of fax cover sheets.

238
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:46,188
God, Oscar,
will you keep your pants on?

239
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:47,065
It's easy.

240
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,527
"My name is Kevin.

241
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:54,767
I'm an accountant."

242
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:56,332
See, I did the voice.

243
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,475
That's a little derivative.

244
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:59,534
But parody is always derivative.

245
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:00,531
Uh, it's not organic.

246
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:02,741
Do you know what I mean?
Jim does a really good one.

247
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:04,397
Do yours. - Oh, guys.

248
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:05,701
I really refuse to participate.

249
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:08,783
"Michael, can I have an
advance on my paycheck

250
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:12,450
because a Mrs. field cookie
just opened up at the mall."

251
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:14,289
Guys, why don't we
leave the parodies

252
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,958
to the pros at madtv?

253
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,996
"Sorry, Gabe, but that show
hasn't been on in many cookies."

254
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:21,252
Okay.

255
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:24,196
Hey, can I have your
attention, please?

256
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:25,936
First of all, thanks to everyone

257
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:28,874
for helping put this
awesome party together.

258
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,008
And a very special
shout-out to the chair

259
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:35,476
of the party planning committee,
miss Angela Martin.

260
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:36,563
You have outdone yourself.

261
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:40,211
You know what,
I think we can all agree

262
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:42,037
that Angela's not so great, so...

263
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:43,967
I am saying the exact opposite.

264
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,414
Angela is fantastic.

265
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:47,058
No. No. No.

266
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:49,289
- Specific shout-out...
- Stop talking.

267
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,538
Okay.

268
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:52,744
As some of you may know,

269
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:55,295
I have a very special
connection to secretary's day

270
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:59,620
in the form of that 115-pound
moonbeam over there

271
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:00,486
named Erin hannon.

272
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,554
To a lot of you she
may just be the person

273
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:04,045
who brings you your
fax confirmations,

274
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:07,253
but to me, she is my girlfriend...

275
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:09,097
In addition to being the person

276
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:10,643
who brings me my
fax confirmations.

277
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:15,478
So I wrote a Little ditty

278
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:19,248
that I would like to play
for all of you right now.

279
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:21,855
It's a little tune called

280
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:25,788
secretary of love.

281
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:27,765
A one, a two,

282
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:28,966
a one, two, three--

283
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,415
I know about Angela.

284
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,320
I know that you
were engaged to her

285
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:34,572
and that you were
sleeping with her.

286
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,716
Michael told me. - Oh, God.

287
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:39,451
Erin, can we talk
about this in private?

288
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:40,261
I don't want it
to be in private.

289
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:41,223
Is it true or is it not?

290
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,242
- Yes.
- Who else did you sleep with?

291
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:50,658
Did you sleep with
Phyllis or Kelly or Pam?

292
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:51,899
Maybe all together?

293
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,905
- No. No, never.
- Did everyone know?

294
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,152
Was I the only one
who didn't know?

295
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:56,579
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Pretty much.

296
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,330
Who are you? I don't know you.

297
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:01,860
I don't know you!

298
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:07,318
I should probably
get involved in this,

299
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,787
but I think my energy
is better spent

300
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:11,566
on the cookie monster issue.

301
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:14,931
Erin, you know,
if I had been engaged

302
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:16,639
to anybody before you,

303
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,976
I would have told you.

304
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:20,414
Thanks.

305
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:22,058
So if you need anything,

306
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,675
I'm right over there.

307
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,053
"Hey, Erin, you look delicious.

308
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:31,127
I mean, beautiful."

309
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:32,597
Okay.

310
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:34,849
Okay. There. I heard that.

311
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:37,805
So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it.

312
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:40,600
I'm going to have to
suspend you without pay

313
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,326
for two days.

314
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,860
What? What do you mean,
suspend me?

315
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:45,607
I think you need
to go a little easy.

316
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,236
You can't just suspend
someone from work.

317
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:48,572
Yeah, you're right.
You know what?

318
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:50,148
Um, you're suspended too, Jim.

319
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:55,885
Okay. - Fine. You too, Dwight.

320
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:57,042
Wait, what?

321
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,083
I was just slow-clapping

322
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,430
your no-nonsense decision-making.

323
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:00,515
I don't want to hear it.

324
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:02,119
Suspended.

325
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:06,905
"C" is for suspension.

326
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:13,339
Why would that be something
that you would talk about

327
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,471
on secretary's day?

328
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:16,426
Andy, she's not the
easiest person in the world

329
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,550
to have a conversation with.

330
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:18,851
All right? And besides,

331
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:21,018
who doesn't tell their girlfriend

332
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,794
that they were engaged to someone

333
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:24,857
who works four feet
away from them?

334
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:26,405
That's like-- that's--

335
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,211
that's, like, mr. And Mrs.
smith crap.

336
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:29,437
I was gonna tell her,

337
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:30,881
just on my own time.

338
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:32,272
You know what,
I resent the implication

339
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:34,307
that I would keep that secret.

340
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:36,667
Everyone here knows that I can't

341
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:37,867
and won't keep a secret.

342
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,331
Who cares?

343
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:44,315
I mean, it's not like
I killed somebody.

344
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,091
Big deal, right?

345
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,832
This can blow over in two seconds.

346
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,787
She never asked me, so,
if you think about it...

347
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,416
I probably should have
told her, I guess.

348
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,087
Everybody does stupid things.

349
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,370
Psst. Hey.

350
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:01,956
Erin. - You want to talk to me,

351
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:02,777
come to my desk.

352
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,289
You embarrassed me earlier.

353
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:17,876
Oh, take it up with
the chief of police.

354
00:14:17,877 --> 00:14:19,924
You think I want
people remembering

355
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,170
I had sensual relations with Andy?

356
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:24,163
It's the kind of thing you
wish you could have annulled.

357
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,376
I want to throw up
just thinking about it.

358
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:28,064
I want to throw up just
thinking about it.

359
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:30,649
You are throwing up
for the wrong reasons.

360
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,544
I don't think this
fax is going through.

361
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:37,257
Is there a different...

362
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,225
I can just put it
through again, you know.

363
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:49,111
Hey.

364
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:54,033
You know, I was
engaged before Jim.

365
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:56,805
Really?

366
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,067
Yeah. And he worked here too.

367
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,317
It was Andy, wasn't it?

368
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,763
No, no, it wasn't Andy.

369
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:05,084
It wasn't.

370
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:06,216
It doesn't matter.

371
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:10,298
It's not about who
you've been with.

372
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:12,402
It's about who you end up with.

373
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:15,767
Sometimes the heart
doesn't know what it wants

374
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:17,355
until it finds what it wants.

375
00:15:24,732 --> 00:15:26,290
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

376
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:31,582
Thank you.

377
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,335
So I can reprimand them,
but I can't suspend them.

378
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,086
Oh, I can't do either.

379
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,477
Uh-huh. Fair enough.

380
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,457
Hey, Toby.

381
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,755
I called Tallahassee.

382
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,192
He can ask you not to come in,

383
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:58,682
but he can't dock your pay.

384
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:00,484
That's not legal.
Very interesting.

385
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:02,284
Yeah, I also learned
some interesting things

386
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,216
about how they structure--

387
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:04,882
thanks, Toby.

388
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:06,954
Hey, everyone. Hi.

389
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,916
Quite an afternoon, huh?

390
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,418
Cathartic in a way.

391
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:13,161
I'm glad that I got
to share it with you.

392
00:16:13,162 --> 00:16:16,045
It makes you think about
what's really important.

393
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:18,280
It's not about showing
you're in charge

394
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,994
or flexing some sort of authority.

395
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:21,243
It's about forgiveness.

396
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,877
And, yes, I'm talking
about you three

397
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:24,951
in this desk clump right here.

398
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:27,157
I think that, if you
were to apologize to me,

399
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:29,534
then I would revoke
your suspension.

400
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,508
I don't think an
apology is enough.

401
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:35,017
I really think the only way
for me to learn my lesson

402
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:36,632
is to take my suspension.

403
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:39,156
And I got to take
this bad attitude,

404
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:41,607
and I got to go home,
and I got to adjust it.

405
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,394
And I hope the
suspension does that.

406
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:44,941
Prideful idiots.

407
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:46,190
Watch how it's done.

408
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:49,593
Gabriel, I apologize.

409
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:51,366
Great.

410
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,100
I kneel before you.

411
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:57,522
Guys, I would even
take a contrite look

412
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:58,542
as an apology.

413
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,841
Humbly taking your
hand upon which I kiss

414
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:01,997
to show my contrition.

415
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:06,988
Guys, to err is human.

416
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:15,114
Trust is the most
important thing to me.

417
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,239
Is your name Andy Bernard?

418
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,611
What's your real name?
Lionel frankenstein?

419
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:20,334
Will you stop walking
for one second?

420
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:22,654
That's it.
There's no other secrets.

421
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:26,508
Okay? I mean, yeah,

422
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:28,395
my chest is not
naturally hairless,

423
00:17:28,396 --> 00:17:30,344
and my parents pay
my credit card bill.

424
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:31,655
How long were you guys together?

425
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,686
- A year.
- A year?

426
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:39,492
You were together for a year.

427
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,324
Yeah. But that's it.

428
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:42,743
Now you know everything about me.

429
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,399
I promise.

430
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,800
And if I think of anything else...

431
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:51,159
I think I have to be on
my own for a little bit.

432
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,250
Like that girl precious
in precious:

433
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:55,089
Based on the novel push by sapphire.

434
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,759
Okay?

435
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:58,948
I didn't see that movie.

436
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:05,060
That was ugly.

437
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:06,515
I'm sorry that you
had to see that.

438
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:07,631
Do they still get paid?

439
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:09,172
It's tacky to discuss finances.

440
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,555
It's best to pretend
that this never happened.

441
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:13,695
Sounds like they just
got to go home with pay.

442
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:14,861
- Yeah.
- Pathetic.

443
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:17,796
- Very nice.
- Can I buy everyone coffees?

444
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:22,484
"Or cookies."

445
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:26,009
- Oh.
- What was that?

446
00:18:26,928 --> 00:18:27,910
Was that an impression?

447
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:28,925
All right.

448
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,328
Uh, guys,

449
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:32,914
I'm now going to apologize

450
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:34,339
for the mess that we're in.

451
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,761
Because corporate told me to.

452
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,482
I just want you to know I
laugh like a crazy person.

453
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:41,958
Okay.

454
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,522
You got to be able to-
you got to be able

455
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:43,880
to laugh at yourself.

456
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,202
I'm one of the gang.

457
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:47,317
"I have to go back to the zoo

458
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:49,066
to the stick insect exhibit."

459
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:54,155
"Ciao."

460
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,578
Right? "Ciao.

461
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,527
I say ciao 'cause I'm
fancy from Tallahassee."

462
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:03,323
Why don't we say "ciao"
to the impressions?

463
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,284
Ciao.

464
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:08,612
- Ciao. Filming.
- Ciao, stick insect.

465
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:10,455
Ciao.

466
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:12,948
God.

467
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:17,462
- Erin?
- Oh.

468
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,720
Sorry. I thought
everyone was gone.

469
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:21,393
No, no, I was just
watching cookie monster.

470
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,300
Finally downloaded.
Mind if I sit down?

471
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:25,336
- Yeah.
- What's, um...

472
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:29,558
I can't trust Andy anymore.

473
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,369
Oh. Yep.

474
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,208
I'm sorry about that.

475
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,611
I feel-- I'm sorry I
caused that thing.

476
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:36,745
It's Andy's fault.

477
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:38,555
Well, yeah, yes.

478
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,516
But I still feel sorry.

479
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:45,519
Oh.

480
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,856
You know what,
I wouldn't worry about Angela.

481
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:50,361
She's-- she doesn't hold a candle

482
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:51,435
to you, Erin.

483
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:55,104
She's old enough to be
your mom for one thing,

484
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:58,979
and she's, like, three feet tall.

485
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,431
And she wears pioneer
women clothing.

486
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:07,541
And I don't think
she's ever pooped

487
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:08,827
in her life.

488
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:11,839
And Andy, you know, come on.

489
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,549
Andy, his butt looks
big in those khakis.

490
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,679
Oh, I like his butt.

491
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:19,013
You said butt.

492
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:21,311
- You tricked me.
- Ahh!

493
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:22,791
Ahh.

494
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,692
You said it.
You know who'd you love?

495
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,613
Oh, this guy

496
00:20:28,614 --> 00:20:30,316
in my neighborhood, Tom dizemore.

497
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:34,984
This is him. "Hey! Hey, Scott!"

498
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,890
Sometimes,
telling someone something

499
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:38,701
is hard.

500
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:44,197
Well, at least somebody made
her happy on secretary's day.

501
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:46,974
Hey, Kevin, it's Oscar.

502
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,478
I'm looking at the
sheet you sent me.

503
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:51,117
And I can't seem to find the
column for shipping costs

504
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:54,960
I made the most brilliant
the retaliation video.

505
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:57,638
It is so awesome.

506
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:58,886
I don't get it.

507
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:02,018
Yeah, I mean, the Count
has a very distinct voice.

508
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,075
Yeah. "I vant to count to ten."

509
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,913
But Oscar is an accountant,

510
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:09,428
and the Count counts numbers.

511
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,449
Your an accountant too,
so, it doesn't...

512
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,749
Why didn't you do Oscar the grouch

513
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,571
that would have been funny.
That would have been funny.

514
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:17,625
But the Count is purple,
and Oscar wears purple.

515
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,713
Oh! Oh! I was just watching that.

516
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:21,324
Did you do that man?

517
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:22,661
Oscar!

518
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:24,141
I am the Count...

519
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:26,294
Nailed him. Nailed him!

520
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:27,623
Good work cookie monster.

521
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:29,559
Thank you.
