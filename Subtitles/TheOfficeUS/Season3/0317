1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,028
Hey, Kevin. Nice of you to join us.
Where were you?

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,631
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,871
I almost died. I went into this skid...
Pop quiz.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,173
What?
Why is today a special day?

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,682
I almost died.
Today is a special day

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,651
because I am being honored

7
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:24,580
as a visiting professor.

8
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,386
Special lecturer?

9
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,620
Emeritus, how did you put it?

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,028
You will be a guest speaker
in my Emerging Enterprises class.

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,192
In business school, Kevin.

12
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,200
Business school.
Wow.

13
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,202
If you bring your boss to class,

14
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,740
it automatically bumps you up
a full-letter grade.

15
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,599
So,

16
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,675
I'd be stupid not to do it, right?

17
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,646
A boss is like a teacher.

18
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,776
And I am like the cool teacher.

19
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,948
Like Mr. Handell.

20
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:59,856
Mr. Handell would hang out with us,
and he would tell us awesome jokes.

21
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,160
And he actually
hooked up with one of the students,

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,362
and then, like, 1 2 other kids came forward.

23
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,262
It was in all the papers.

24
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,636
Really ruined eighth grade for us.

25
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,458
Here we go. College road show.
Gotta bring our A game.

26
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,897
What is the most inspiring thing
I ever said to you?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,264
"Don't be an idiot." Changed my life.

28
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,334
Whenever I'm about to do something,
I think, "Would an idiot do that?"

29
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,206
And if they would, I do not do that thing.

30
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,811
Will they throw their hats, you think?
What?

31
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,784
A lot of times, at a school or naval academy,

32
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:03,152
after a rousing speech the crowd will
throw its hats high into the air.

33
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,522
You understand, nobody's graduating.
Yeah, I know. I know.

34
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,494
I'm just saying, if they did throw their hats,
I've got a great line for that.

35
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:15,191
May your hats fly as high your <i>dreams!</i>

36
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,572
That was a pretty good line.
I'm just...

37
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:27,739
It doesn't apply.
I <i>understand! Wow!</i> Relax, spazzy <i>boy!</i>

38
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,873
Sometimes you're such a little <i>spaz!</i>
God, I'm <i>driving!</i>

39
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,382
<i>Hey!</i>
Quit it.

40
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,643
We have <i>fun!</i>

41
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,313
I can't wait for your art show tonight.

42
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,780
Okay, just so you know,

43
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,188
it's just the students from my class
in a little studio.

44
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,490
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Thanks.

45
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,826
I'm really happy to be back with Roy.

46
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:49,933
I think it shows maturity,
maturity and dignity.

47
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,732
Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.

48
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,075
Love <i>you!</i>
You, too.

49
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,406
<i>Pam's with Roy, I'm with Karen,</i>

50
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,310
and Brangelina is with Frangelina.
Moving <i>on!</i>

51
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,485
I can't believe
you're back together with Roy.

52
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,083
Oh, yeah.
We have such a solid foundation, you know.

53
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,992
Oh, my God, you're so in love now.

54
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,088
Yeah. You should come to my art show,
by the way.

55
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,123
Art <i>show!</i>

56
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,429
I mean, it's not a big deal,

57
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,860
but I think a lot of people from the office
are gonna be there.

58
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,568
Yeah. Definitely, I'll be there. For sure.

59
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:38,006
Campus. Brings back so many memories
that I would have made.

60
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,785
Hey, <i>Frisbee!</i> Check that <i>out!</i>

61
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,919
What do you say
we get our frizz on before class? Come on.

00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,955
Dwight, what are you doing?

68
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,931
Solving a mystery,
if that's quite all right with <i>you!</i>

69
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,439
Come to <i>papa!</i>

70
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,041
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

71
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,809
What we have here is a bird
that has been trapped in a vent.

72
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,308
Fortunately, I have found it before...

Please don't let that stupid thing

Please make it go <i>away!</i>

82
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,037
Okay. This is it.
Ryan is doing my intro right now.

83
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,570
Dunder Mifflin can't compete
with the modern chains,

84
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,379
and management is unwilling
or unable to adapt.

85
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,713
Their customers are dying off...

86
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:27,087
I can't hear what he's saying,
but he looks like he's really into it.

(SCREAMS)

88
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,928
We have a bat in the office.

89
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,338
Simple solution would be to open a window,

90
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,041
if we had windows that could open.

91
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,441
Poop is raining from the ceilings.

92
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,101
Poop.

93
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,579
JIM: Okay, thanks.

94
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,879
Animal Control will be here at 6:00.

95
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,853
At 6:00? No, that is unacceptable.

96
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,017
Okay, Jim.
You are the number two in this office.

97
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,718
You need to step up
and show some <i>leadership!</i>

98
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,622
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

99
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,363
So weird.
What? What's so weird?

100
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,633
The bat... I mean, I know I felt it bite me,
but look, there's no mark.

101
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,264
I feel so tingly,

102
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,499
so strangely powerful.

103
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,539
Oh, well.

104
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,612
And now, without further ado,

105
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,885
I present the regional manager
of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.

Hello, everyone, I am Michael Scott...

109
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,233
<i>Hello, I'm Brandon Fidalgo,</i>
<i>CEO of The Teaching Company. These...</i>

110
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,940
And I'd like to start today by inspiring you.

111
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,980
May I borrow someone's textbook, please?

112
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,247
Thank you.

113
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:08,820
What have we here? Ooh, economics.
Very, very interesting.

114
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,662
You cannot learn from books.

115
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,610
Replace these pages with life lessons,

116
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:29,478
and then you will have a book

117
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,544
that is worth its weight in gold.

118
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:40,384
I know, those are expensive,
but the lesson is priceless.

119
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,082
Good.

120
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:46,456
All right, I think you're inspired.
Shall we proceed?

121
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,530
There are four kinds of business,

122
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:55,700
tourism, food service, railroads and sales.

123
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,812
And hospitalslmanufacturing.

124
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,414
And air travel.

125
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,885
This is your job, Halpert.

126
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,477
JIM: <i>Ow!</i>

127
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,451
What happened?

128
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,891
That bread on your desk. I just picked it up.
It's white hot.

129
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,022
But, Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
What?

130
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,462
No, it burned me, I...

131
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,096
Bizarre.

132
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,700
No.

133
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,441
No. One crisis at a time.

134
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,273
If a vampire bat was in the U.S.

135
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:40,149
It would make sense for it to come
to a "Sylvania," like Pennsylvania.

136
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,746
<i>Now, that doesn't mean</i>
<i>that Jim is gonna become a vampire.</i>

137
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,482
<i>Only that he carries the vampiric germ.</i>

138
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,927
So, you want to start a business.
How do you start?

139
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,495
What do you need?
Well, first of all, you need a building.

140
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:02,433
And secondly, you need supply,
you need something to sell.

141
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,133
Now, this could be anything.

142
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:10,945
It could be a thingamajig
or a who's- he-what's- he

143
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,544
or a Whatchamacallit.

144
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:23,184
Now, you need to sell those
in order to have a PayDay.

145
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,824
And if you sell enough of them,

146
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:32,365
you will make a 100 GRAND.

147
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,203
Satisfied?

148
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,971
This looks great. I'd love to be there,
but my daughter's play is tonight.

149
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,511
Damn <i>it!</i>

150
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,019
You know, one of the other parents
will probably videotape it.

151
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,249
So...
Oh, no, you should go.

152
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,589
Well, it's important to support local art.

153
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,024
You know? And what they do is not art.

154
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,463
Okay,
I'm seeing some confused faces out there.

155
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,026
Let me slow down a little bit,
break this down.

156
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,162
Okay.

157
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,101
The more stickers you sell, the more profit,

158
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:11,736
fancy word for money,

159
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:16,043
you have to buy
PlayStations and Beanie Babies...

160
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,139
Michael...
...and <i>products!</i>

161
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,810
What we normally do here is
more of a question and answer thing.

162
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,216
Well, okay... I'm just kind of getting going...

163
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,051
Yeah, I know.
All right, okay.

164
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,092
Well, we can do questions.
Okay, very good. First hand up.

165
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,185
Sir, as a company
that primarily distributes paper,

166
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,992
how have you adapted
your business model to function

167
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,260
in an increasingly paperless world?

168
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,633
We can't overestimate
the value of computers.

169
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:43,038
Yes, they are great for playing games
and forwarding funny e-mails,

170
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,806
but real business is done on paper, okay?

171
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,878
Write that down.

172
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,855
Hey, Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.

173
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,949
Oh, thank God.
I've such a headache from that glare.

174
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,221
What glare?

175
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,019
The glare off Angela's crucifix. It's blinding.

176
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,397
I don't have a lot of experience
with vampires,

177
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,897
but I have hunted werewolves.

178
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:17,400
I shot one once, but by the time I got to it,
it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.

179
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,376
Extraordinary events call
for extraordinary actions.

180
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,077
Will you form an allegiance...
Sure.

181
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,146
...to use sudden violence?
Okay.

182
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,957
Do you have the tools
to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?

183
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,424
What size?

184
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,193
What do you say to a customer
who wants to leave you

185
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,294
for the convenience and savings
of a nationwide chain?

186
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,429
I say, "You will miss our service

187
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,498
"and I absolutely guarantee
you'll come back."

188
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,305
Has anyone ever come back?

189
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,136
We don't want them back. They're stupid.

190
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,910
How far has your Herfindahl Index
declined since the merger?

191
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,508
Nice try.
How's your Polack-says-what Index?

192
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,312
What?
Thanks, Kowalski.

193
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,447
Can we get back on track here?

194
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,718
By your own employee's calculation,

195
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,522
you'll be obsolete
in the next five to ten years.

196
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,821
Wait. Ryan said that?

197
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,808
What are you doing?

198
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:28,439
You better not hurt that little bat.
Animals can't feel pain.

199
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,811
Don't hurt that bat, <i>Creed!</i>

200
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,180
It's a living thing with feelings and a <i>family!</i>

201
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:36,085
Flush him towards the door.
On my <i>go! Now!</i>

202
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,488
<i>Bat!</i>
Kill <i>it!</i> Kill <i>it!</i> Kill <i>it!</i>

203
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,161
I am a hero.

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,729
Yeah, sure. You know business.

205
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:54,432
Sitting up here in your ivory tower
and your ebony tower.

206
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,741
Well, you know what?

207
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,869
I tell you one thing,
Dunder Mifflin is here to <i>stay!</i>

208
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,503
But how can you compete
against a company

209
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,945
with the resources of a nationwide chain?

210
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,313
David will always beat <i>Goliath!</i>

211
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,045
But there's five Goliaths.

212
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,679
There's Staples, OfficeMax...
Yeah, yeah.

213
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,815
You know what else is facing five Goliaths?

214
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,827
America. Al-Qaeda.

215
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,231
Global warming. Sex predators.

216
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,829
Mercury poisoning.

217
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,001
So do we just give up?

218
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,970
Is that
what we're learning in business school?

219
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,566
But in the big picture, you have...
Dunder Mifflin is the big <i>picture!</i>

220
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,170
Can't you understand that?
No, you can't, you're too young.

221
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,442
Ryan has never made a sale.

222
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,623
And he started a fire,
trying to make a cheesy pita.

223
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,919
And everybody thinks he's a tease.
Well, you know what?

224
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,755
He doesn't know anything
and neither do you.

225
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,204
So, suck on <i>that!</i>

226
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,132
It wasn't personal.
Business is always personal.

227
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,632
It's the most personal thing in the world.

228
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,498
When we get back to the office,
pack your things.

229
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,060
Pack my...
You heard me. Pack your things.

230
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,579
I really want to come <i>out!</i>
Good night, Mary <i>Beth!</i>

231
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,459
So, you're cool to just wait here
for Animal Control?

232
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,125
Animal Control?

233
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,866
I've been controlling animals
since I was six.

234
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,566
Cool. Okay.

235
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,677
I'm gonna go home and lie down,
draw the shades.

236
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,839
There's just so much sun in here.

237
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,946
Bye, Dwight.

238
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,487
Goodbye, Jim.

239
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:30,990
And good luck.

240
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,127
Jim is on a path now,

241
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,836
an eternal journey, and I wish him well.

242
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,633
But I have a destiny in this realm.

243
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,735
Specifically, in the kitchen.

244
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,840
And it's all from the same series.

245
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,440
Called Impressions.

246
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,383
Not that I would call myself
an impressionist per se.

247
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,286
But maybe one day.
I hope so.

248
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,823
I still need,
you know, my breakthrough or whatever.

249
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,760
Hey, babe.
ROY: <i>Hey!</i>

250
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,361
How are you?
Good.

251
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,170
I brought my brother.
Hey, Kenny.

252
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,765
Hey, Pam.
Hey.

253
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,841
How about this, huh?

254
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,212
I show up with my brother
and no one from work is here.

255
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,046
That's pretty cool, huh?

256
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,388
(DWIGHT BREATHING HEAVILY)

257
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,783
Magic time.

258
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,553
(YELLING)

259
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,929
(SCREAMING)

260
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,528
My <i>hair!</i>

261
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,464
Get <i>off!</i> Get off <i>me!</i>

262
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,236
Get it off <i>me!</i> Get off <i>me!</i>
Hold still, <i>woman!</i>

263
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,278
Get it <i>off!</i>
I got <i>it!</i> I got <i>it!</i>

264
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,437
Get it <i>off!</i>

265
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,338
(SCREAMING)

266
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,347
You're welcome.

267
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,026
ROY: It's cool if I go, right?
I mean, I looked at all of them.

268
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,794
Yeah. I'll just... I'll drive myself home.

269
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,527
To my place?

270
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,369
Maybe. I'm a little tired.

271
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:26,606
Your art was the prettiest art of all the art.

272
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,771
Thank you.

273
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,840
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

274
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,385
I was just trying to do my presentation.

275
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,650
And, of course I was wrong

276
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,091
to suggest that Dunder Mifflin
might ever go out of business.

277
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,562
But you don't have to fire me.

278
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,022
Fire you? No, no, no.

279
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,899
You are moving to the annex.

280
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,266
To the annex?

281
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,331
Where Kelly is?

282
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,342
A good manager doesn't fire people.
He hires people and inspires people.

283
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,273
People, Ryan.

284
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,718
And people will never go out of business.

285
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,480
You're the one who said
we needed more culture.

286
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,789
This is culture to you?
It's her first try.

287
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,228
Yeah. On Van Gogh's first try,
he drew the hands of the peasants.

288
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,526
Meaning what?

289
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,537
Meaning real art takes courage, okay,
and honesty.

290
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,564
Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
Yeah, exactly. That's why this is motel art.

291
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,247
Thanks for coming.

292
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:52,821
<i>Pamcasso!</i>

293
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,528
Sorry I'm late. I had to race across town.
Oh, Michael.

294
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,325
<i>Wow!</i>

295
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,297
You did these? Freehand?
Yep.

296
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,605
My God, these could be tracings.

297
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,872
Look at this one. <i>Wow!</i>

298
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,245
You nailed it.

299
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,249
How much?

300
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,888
What do you mean?
I don't see a price.

301
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,491
You want to buy it?
Well, yeah.

302
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,534
Yeah, we have to have it for the office.

303
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,906
I mean, there's my window.

304
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,440
And there's my <i>car!</i>

305
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,775
Is that your car?

306
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,474
That is our building.

307
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,780
And we sell paper.

308
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,028
I am really proud of you.

309
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,335
Thank you.

310
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,334
What?

311
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,144
Do you have something in your pocket?

312
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,248
A Chunky.

313
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,825
Do you want half?
No, thank you.

314
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,185
Okay.

315
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,593
<i>MICHAEL: It is a message.</i>

316
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:41,834
<i>It is an inspiration. It is a source of beauty.</i>

317
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:47,302
And without paper,
it could not have happened.

318
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,375
Unless you had a camera.

319
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,850
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

320
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,321
Oh, my <i>God!</i> Oh, my <i>God!</i>
Oh, my <i>God!</i> Oh, my <i>God!</i>

321
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,621
Oh, my <i>God!</i> Oh, my <i>God!</i> Oh, my <i>God!</i>
It's only temporary, okay?

322
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,560
Don't get excited.
I won't. I won't. I won't.

323
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,893
I won't. I <i>won't!</i> I <i>won't!</i>

324
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,990
I <i>won't!</i> I <i>won't!</i> I <i>won't!</i> I <i>won't!</i> I <i>won't!</i>
