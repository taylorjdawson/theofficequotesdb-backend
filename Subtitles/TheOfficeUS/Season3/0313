1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,596
Angela.
What?

2
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,140
That was a voicemail
that corporate left last night.

3
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,637
They did not get our tax forms.

4
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,339
Did you send them?

5
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,847
They arrived this morning.

6
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,041
Are you sure?

7
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,181
It is a big deal if...
Is it a big deal?

8
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,853
Is it, Kevin?

9
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,321
Do you really not know?

10
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,881
Because it is a big deal.

11
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,125
<i>AND Y: Five of us transferred from Stamford.</i>

12
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,160
<i>There's two of us left. Me and Karen.</i>

13
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,697
It's like we're touring
Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory

14
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,362
and dropping off one by one.

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,066
Well, guess what?

16
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,471
I'm not falling in a chocolate river.

17
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,343
Everything okay?

18
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,016
It's fine. You are in the clear.

19
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:30,813
Thank you.

20
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,158
I don't want those.

21
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,261
Dwight, care to join us? Finally.

22
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,067
Thank you.

23
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,132
Hey, Dwight, pass the tardy sauce.

24
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,266
Get it, Michael?
Yes.

25
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,570
Okay.

26
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,611
Here is the dream team.

27
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,677
My sales dream team.

28
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,307
Today we are going to team up
for sales calls.

29
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,819
Andy, since this was your idea,
you get to pick first.

30
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:05,115
Well, let me think about this for a minute.

31
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,490
Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott?

32
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,056
PhD. Doctor of sales.

33
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,459
MICHAEL: Well, I appreciate that.
That's very gracious of you.

34
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:18,664
Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
Well, thank you, sir.

35
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,037
Okay, now going by seniority.

36
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,803
Phyllis, our resident senior.

37
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,806
We're the same age.

38
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,544
And I'll pick Karen.

39
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,014
Oh, thanks.

40
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,576
MICHAEL: Good.

41
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,785
Next up, the Super Fly himself, Stanley.
Pass.

42
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,819
You can't pass. You gotta pick somebody.

43
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,857
I'll take the kid.

44
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,901
I'm very flattered.
I was his second choice after pass.

45
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,094
So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.

46
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,298
Okay, wait. Does anyone want to trade?

47
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,002
Yeah, I'll trade.

48
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,708
Dwight and I used to go on sales calls
all the time.

49
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,873
In fact, I have a picture
to remember that time.

50
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,044
Oh, young Jim.

51
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:08,713
There's just so much I need
to warn you about

52
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,719
and yet, tragically, I cannot.

53
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,084
Sebring by Chrysler.

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,023
A heck of a motor carriage.

DWIGHT: Yeah?

56
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,832

60
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,471
Long story.

All right, everybody, circle <i>up!</i>

62
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,542
MICHAEL: Here we go.

63
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,470
You know what this is?

64
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,208
This is <i>The Amazing Race.</i>

65
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:40,378
And you guys are retired Marines,
and you guys are the mother-daughter,

66
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:45,356
and you guys are the gay couple,

67
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,517
Are we ready to go?
KAREN: Wait.

68
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,528
<i>Amazing Race,</i> like, the biggest sale wins?

69
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,793
No. We're just gonna rush out,
do the sales thing and come back.

70
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,799
Is there a prize?
Just bragging rights.

71
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,266
Then how is this <i>Amazing Race?</i>

72
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,325
It's just...

We're in teams of two

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,477
All right. So, on your mark. Get set. Go.

Let's go get a broom.

84

Seriously, are you gonna sit in the back?

85
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,957
Yeah. It's the safest part of a car.

86
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,368
In the event of a crash,
the driver always protects his side first.

87
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,541
Here we go.

<i>AND Y: In order to take down Dwight,</i>
<i>I have to chip away at his ally.</i>

89
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,809
In this case, Michael.

90
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,009
And here's the good news.

91
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,753
Every success I've ever had in my job
or with the lady folk

92
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:56,258
has come from my ability
to slowly and painfully wear someone down.

93
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,425
What's the deal
with Dwight doing your laundry?

94
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,465
That is a long story.

95
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:09,267
A couple of months ago,
Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan

96
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,904
and get my job.

97
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,310
And I am now having him
do my laundry as punishment.

98
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:19,380
Wow. That is a long story,
but quite well told, Michael.

99
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,445
I find it very interesting.

100
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,786
Especially the part about Dwight
going behind your back

101
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,849
and basically being, like, a terrible person.

102
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,659
You know,
if you want your laundry done right,

103
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,028
I used to work at Abercrombie, so...

104
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,897
Pretty good folder.

105
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,298
Hey, Pam.

106
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,563
Would you like to go with me
to grab a coffee?

107
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,232
Really?
Yeah.

108
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,540
I thought you could use some fresh air
and it might be fun.

109
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,477
Okay. Sure.

110
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,640
Okay.

111
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,656
Why are we turning in here?
This is a beauty salon.

112
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,320
Hey, do you mind if I take
the lead on this one

113
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,556
and then you can critique me after?

114
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,063
You want the lead?

115
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,396
Yeah, if you don't mind.
Mind?

116
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,698
Nothing would delight me more.

117
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,071
Leave the keys.

an amazing team at Scranton.

00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,532
It's really a pleasure to be a part of it.

122
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,409
It's like everyone has their own special skill,
you know.

123
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,842
Just like the <i>Super Friends.</i>

124
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,708
Except for Dwight,
who's kind of more of a Super Dud.

125
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,879
I mean, he'd be a Super Friend
if there was a Super Friend

126
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,652
whose super power was always being late.

127
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,682

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,034
but I don't give up easily.

135
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,046
I never let anyone walk behind me.

136
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,092
Seven out of 10 attacks are from the rear.

137
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,287
Okay. Well, that still leaves a <i>30%</i> chance
that I'll attack you from the front.

138
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,489
Yeah, but it'll be easier to stop.

139
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,090
I can always block the blow.
Or I can counter it...

140
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,033
Angela, you seem so happy.

141
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,605
I bet you wish you were like this all the time.

142
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:07,118
This friend of mine... Let's call her "Noel."

143
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,687
She missed this deadline turning something
into corporate in New York.

144
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,092
But then this gallant gentleman,
we'll call him "Kurt."

145
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,962
He drove all the way to New York
and handed it in for her.

146
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,001
That's... I don't know.

147
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,230
I guess he just really likes her a lot.

148
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,867
Well, that's great.

149
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,497
Yes, it is.

Hey.

00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,010
Did you catch that up
at Lake Wallenpaupack?

153
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,109
Yeah.

154
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,984
You know, I used to go up there
all the time with my step-dad

155
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,649
and I never caught anything that big.

156
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,792
I caught an 80-pound shark off Montauk.

157
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,887
That's in the Hamptons.

158
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,056
My dad's got a 42-foot Bayliner.

159
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,124
Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's- nest.

160
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,328
Also shot a deer once.

161
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,373
You know what? Let's get right down to it.

162
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,035
Dunder Mifflin may be just two rooms
and a warehouse,

163
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,601
but what we lack in flash,

164
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,080
we will make up for with hard work
and decency.

165
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,277
Okay, this is the classic undersell.

166
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,549

we don't work out of a log cabin.

Ever heard of it? It's in New York.

168
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,461
I have to say I'm a little wary
of getting involved with a big company.

169
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,090
We've had some problems in the past.

170
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,659
And I think what Andy is
trying to express is that

171
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,539
while we have the resources
of a large company,

172
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,872
we will give you the care and attention
of a small company.

173
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,742
Man, that is like poetry.

174
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,806
I swear.
No.

175
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,715
This guy could sell paper to a tree stump.

176
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,249
I'm so sorry, man.

177
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,686
I really screwed that up.

178
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,351
I really...
No. Don't worry about it.

179
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,328
I really Schruted it.

180
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,622
What?

181
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,222
I Schruted it.

182
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,995
It's just this thing people say
around your office all the time.

183
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,970
Like when you screw something up in
a really irreversible way,

184
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:07,962
you Schruted it.

185
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,369
I don't know where it comes from, though.

186
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,412
You think it comes from Dwight Schrute?

187
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,448
I don't know. Who knows
how words are formed.

188
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,082
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

189
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,720
This is Pam.

190
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,784
I did?

191
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,452
Yeah, I did a watercolor
of Francis Willard Elementary School

192
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,392
for a contest they were having.

193
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,256
They were calling with the results.

194
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,698
And I won.

195
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,502
I won. My painting <i>won!</i>

196
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,663
<i>So I'd like to thank my mom</i>
<i>for always encouraging me.</i>

197
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,205
And I'd like to thank my dad
for buying me my first set of art pencils.

198
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,372
And I'd like to thank the sixth-grade class
that picked me.

199
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,374
It's a big order.

200
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,146
Thanks, Ken.
Yeah, thank you.

201
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,484
Hey, how's Annie?
She's great.

202
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,421
This is us last year in Bermuda.

203
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,923
Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?

204
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,627
JULIUS: Stanley Hudson.
Julius, how's it going?

205
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:12,102
Great, great, great.
Stanley, so good to see you.

206
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,365
You, too.

207
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,407
I'd like you fellows to meet Ryan Howard.

208
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,202
Hi.
Yeah. I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch

209
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,677
for you while I do my crossword puzzle.
Ryan.

210
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,220
Hi. Hi. Hi.

211
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,917
Hello, Ryan.
Hi.

212
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,222
What do you have for us?

213
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:43,257
We can offer our biggest discounts
on <i>30%</i> recycled and ultra premium laser.

214
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,700
Okay. Okay.

215
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,169
Can I use your phone?

216
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,830
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
Thanks.

217
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,000
Let me talk to you about a few
of the other things we can offer.

218
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,976
Namely, we know that tax season's
coming up,

219
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,103
so by April 1st
we can have you fully stocked.

220
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,148
We have discount prices on ink cartridges.
DWIGHT: One.

221
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,239
Three.

222
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,647
And also any forms
that you're gonna need...

223
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,084
Seven.
...we can custom make them.

224
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,950
Hey, Kev, guess what?

225
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,823
I won an art contest today.

226
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,021
How much did you win?
$100.

227
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:16,433
I won 400 bucks
on the Celtics game last night.

228
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,930
Cool. Congratulations.

229
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,901
Thanks.

230
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,805
It was so sweet.

231
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,450
(LAUGHING)

232
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,057
And you just said, <i>"Hi! Hi! Hi!"</i>

233
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,588
You sounded like my niece.

234
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,822
And she's six months <i>old!</i>

235
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,161
Well, I appreciate what you guys are saying,

236
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,672
but it makes more fiscal sense
to go with one of the big guys.

237
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,002
Sure.
That's true.

238
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,235
We can't compete with their prices.

239
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,435
But let me ask you something.

240
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,809
How important to you is customer service?
Very.

241
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,940
<i>ELECTRONIC VOICE: Please keep holding.</i>
<i>Your call is very important to us.</i>

242
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,212
That's one of the big guys.
Been on hold this whole time.

243
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,680
And this is Dunder Mifflin.

244
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,916
<i>KELLY: Dunder Mifflin customer service.</i>
<i>This is Kelly.</i>

245
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,392
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.

246
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,430
<i>Oh, my God! Jim! How are you?</i>
<i>I wanted to tell you...</i>

247
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,862
Here's my card.

248
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,456
It's got my cell number, my pager number,

249
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,229
my home number
and my other pager number.

250
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,965
I never take vacations. I never get sick.
And I don't celebrate any major holidays.

251
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,802
All right. I get it.

252
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,933
We got a deal.
All right.

253
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,539
Hey, Angela, I got good news today, too.

254
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,248
I won an art contest.

255
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,180
That's great, Pam.

256
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,220
I like having these little moments with you.

257
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,453
You know what?
Sprinkles recently had kittens.

258
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,965
I would like to offer you the dominant male.

259
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,127
His name is Ash.

260
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,706
I don't think so. But thanks.

261
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,838
My building manager is...

262
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,242
You understand.

263
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,856
Well then, have a nice day.

264
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,952
Thanks. That was fun.

265
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,965
Yeah. I really enjoy spending time with you.
You're a very nice person.

266
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,364
Thank you.

267
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,362
I'm so glad you're with Jim.

268
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,270
He was hung-up on Pam
for such a long time.

269
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,635
I didn't think he'd ever get over her.

270
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,811
That's nice.

271
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,483
You can pay me back later for the makeover.

272
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,318
<i>AND Y: Hey, boss. Got a minute?</i>
<i>MICHAEL: Yes, Andy.</i>

273
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,321
<i>AND Y: I forget. Why did Dwight say</i>
<i>he was late this morning?</i>

274
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,991
<i>MICHAEL: He didn't say.</i>
<i>That's weird.</i>

275
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,468
<i>Because I was just walking past his desk</i>
<i>and I saw this,</i>

276
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,700
<i>which is a toll booth receipt</i>
<i>from New York City,</i>

277
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,571
stamped really early this morning.

278
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,802
So...

279
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:17,003
Why would Dwight go to New York
without telling anyone?

280
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,483
You think he went to see Jan?

281
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,051
That's not like him, is it?

282
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:28,323
Someone told me a story about this...
With like laundry and betrayal.

283
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,690
Did you betray Dwight
and try to steal his job or something?

284
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,790
No.

285
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,629
You are remembering it wrong.

286
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,935
Dwight betrayed me once before.

287
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,567
So this is his strike two.

288
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,770
You know what they say?

289
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,835
"Fool me once, strike one.

290
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,443
"But fool me twice,

291
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,942
"strike three."

292
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,483
<i>JAN: Dwight's name is on</i>
<i>the security sign-in sheet,</i>

293
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,391
<i>but I don't know who he met with.</i>

294
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,357
<i>And where it asks to state your business,</i>

295
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,830
<i>he wrote,</i>
<i>"Beeswax Not Yours Incorporated."</i>

296
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,230
I knew it.

297
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,262
Oh, doggie.

298
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,399
Hey, you wanna grab a coffee?

299
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,403
Sure.

300
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,178
Look at you.

301
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:23,807
Yeah.

302
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,779
Beesly, coffee?

303
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,786
No, thanks, I had some already.
All right.

304
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,048
But, hey, Jim.
Yeah?

305
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,523
I won an art contest today.

306
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,422
No <i>way!</i>
Yeah.

307
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,987
All right, Pam. Congratulations.
Thanks.

308
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,120
Which one was it?

309
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,290
I sent them one of my watercolors.
Cool.

310
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,233
It was a new one I did.
Are you ready, Jim?

311
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,600
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Yeah.

312
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,002
Congratulations.
Thanks.

313
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,061
Big deal.

314
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,545
<i>Hey!</i> We nailed the sale.

315
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,016
Where were you this morning?

316
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,149
I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.

317
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,157
Why do you lie, liar?
I'm not a liar.

318
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,092
You are lying right now.
Sure seems like he's lying.

319
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,628
Stay out of this, <i>you!</i>

320
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,062
I know that you went
to corporate this morning.

321
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,192
And I know that you lied about it.

322
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,538
And given our history,
I need you to tell me right now

323
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,637
exactly what you were doing this morning.

324
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,777
Michael, I cannot tell you
what I was doing there.

325
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,803
But you have to trust me.

326
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,247
I would never do anything
to hurt you or this company.

327
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,544
Okay, you know what?

328
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,212
I want you to think about your future
at this company.

329
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,187
I want you to think about it long and hard.

330
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,053
That's what she said.
Don't...

331
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,949
Don't you dare.

332
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,461
I want to know what you were doing
this morning by the end of the day.

333
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,267
It's gonna be okay.

334
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,540
How's it gonna be okay, Dwight?

335
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,576
Everyone will know our business.

336
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,373
Well, that's not the worst thing in the world.

337
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,881
I'll just stand up in front of the office
and reveal our true love.

338
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,047
It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.

339
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,690
I hate those two people
more than anything in the entire world.

340
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,661
Well, I don't have a lot of choices.

341
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,064
KAREN: So, let me ask you a question.
Okay.

342
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,795
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?

343
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:28,363
Pam? Did I ever have a thing for her? No.

344
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,635
Why? Did she say something?

345
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,741
I moved here from Connecticut.

346
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,239
Yeah.

347
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,911
Okay, here's the...

348
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:45,483
I had a crush on her before I left.

349
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,886
And I told her about it
and she didn't feel the same way.

350
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,128
So it didn't amount to anything and I left.

351
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,895
I'm really glad you're here.

352
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,530
Okay?

353
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,932
Okay.

354
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,844
(CLEARING THROAT)

355
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,242
May I have your attention, please?

356
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,816
This will only take a moment of your time.

357
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,589
"Although I love this company
more than almost anything in the world,

358
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,686
"I have decided to step down from my post
and spend more time with my family.

359
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,594
"I do not fear the unknown.

360
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,192
"I will meet my new challenges head on
and I will succeed.

361
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,329
"And I will laugh in the faces
of those who doubt me.

362
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,067
"It's been a pleasure working
with some of you

363
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,507
"and I will not forget those of you soon.

364
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,478
"But remember, while today it is me,

365
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,310
"we all shall fall."

366
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,345
In other words, I'm quitting, so...

367
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,225
<i>(SINGING) Oompa, Loompa,</i>
<i>doom-pa-dee-dawesome</i>

368
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,393
<i>Dwight is now gone,</i>
<i>which is totally awesome</i>

369
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,523
<i>Why was he gone?</i>

370
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,501
<i>He was such a nice guy</i>

371
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,135
<i>No, he was not</i>

372
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,173
<i>He was a total douche</i>

373
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,235
<i>Doompa-dee-doom</i>

374
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:17,340
I would like to give the rest
of my belongings to Michael Scott.

375
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,818
Just take it.

376
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,318
Except this.

377
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,146
Good luck.
And this one.

378
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,025
Dwight will be missed.

379
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,922
Not by me so much, but he will be missed.

380
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,160
Dwight from sales

381
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,630
was one of the most honorable
and efficient employees

382
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,573
this company has ever had.

383
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,645
<i>DWIGHT: One of my life goals was</i>
<i>to die right here in my desk chair.</i>

384
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,245
And today, that dream was shattered.

385
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,918
Hey, man.

386
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,266
What happened on your sales call?

387
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,709
Am I happy about
the way things turned out?

388
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:24,142
Oh, "Happy's" such an ugly word,

389
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:30,018
but I saw what needed to be done
and I did it and now I'm thrilled.

390
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,985
So, it's pretty...

391
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,118
Hello?

392
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,459
Pretty good.
