1
00:00:32,626 --> 00:00:34,324
Pam ! Pamela,

2
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,169
Pamelamela Ding Dong !
Making copies.

3
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:40,218
- I'm not making any copies.
- Let's go !

4
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:43,702
Messages, date, lots to do lots to do...

5
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:45,090
Information superhighway !

6
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:46,684
- Nothing new...
- Let them unw...

7
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:49,003
- There's nothing new.
- That's not what you said earlier.

8
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:52,475
Oh do you want me to repeat
the messages that I gave you before ?

9
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:53,555
For the...

10
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:02,762
The most sacred thing I do is care,
and provide for my workers, my family.

11
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:04,498
I give them money.

12
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:06,013
I give them food.

13
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:09,048
Not directly, but through the money...

14
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,078
I heal them.

15
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:17,382
Today I am in charge, of picking
a great new healthcare plan.

16
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:19,970
Right ? That's what this is all about !

17
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:24,727
Does that make me their doctor ?

18
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:29,521
Yes... In a way...

19
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,163
Yeah, like a specialist.

20
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,136
So which health plan
have you decided on ?

21
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,508
I am going to go with best, Jan.

22
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,704
I am going to go with the one with

23
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:45,874
the acupuncture, therapeutic massage...

24
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,152
- You know, the works...
- Wait acupuncture ?

25
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,619
None of the plans have acupuncture.

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,808
Have you looked at
them closely Michael ?

27
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,576
I think it was you who didn't look
closely enough at the "gold plan".

28
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,685
- The gold plan ?
- Yep.

29
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,340
I'm not even on that plan.

30
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,500
Well I recommend it, it's very good.

31
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,406
- You have to crack this things open.
- You know the whole reason we're doing

32
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:10,343
this, is to save money.

33
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,140
So,

34
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,787
you just need to pick a provider,
and then choose the cheapest plan.

35
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:18,763
Well that is...

36
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:21,354
kind of a tough assignment.

37
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:26,497
- It's not gonna be a popular
decision around the old orifice.
- It's your job... so

38
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,460
It's a suicide mission, you know...

39
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:31,267
- Michael,
- I, I Know

40
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:33,122
- Maybe, I, I mean...
- There... there

41
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:34,728
You know sometimes a manager...

42
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,227
like yourself,

43
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:39,445
has to deliver the bad news to
the employees, I do it all the time.

44
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:42,556
- Yeah, when have you ever done that ?
- I'm doing it, right now.

45
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,981
To you.

46
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,580
Last night on "Trading spouses"...

47
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:51,267
- There's... have you seen it ?
- No, I have a life.

48
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,427
- Interesting, what's that like ?
- You should try it sometime.

49
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:55,795
Wow

50
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,850
- But then who would watch my TV ?

51
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:58,789
So I like that

52
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,362
Ding Dong !

53
00:03:05,623 --> 00:03:07,105
There's a decision
that needs to be made.

54
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,465
And I'm having a unbelievably busy day.

55
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:13,221
So, I'm going to let you pick

56
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,511
a healthcare plan for our office,

57
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:17,571
and then explain it

58
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:19,438
to your co-workers.

59
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,129
- Gosh !
- Yeah !

60
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,772
That is a great offer. Thank you.

61
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,779
I really think I should be
concentrating on sales.

62
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,380
- Really ?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,621
I just don't thing that this is
the kind of task, that

64
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,992
I am going to do...

65
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:40,979
You know who would be great for this ?

66
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:44,925
Anytime Michael asks me to do anything
I just tell me that Dwight should do it.

67
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,571
Yes ! I can do it ! I'm your man.

68
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:50,725
Right now this is just a job.

69
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:54,617
If I advance any higher in this company,
then this would be my career.

70
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:56,481
And a...

71
00:03:56,558 --> 00:03:59,008
Well if this were my career,

72
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,709
I'd have to throw myself
in front of a train.

73
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,307
Ok first, let's go over some parameters,

74
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,465
how many people can I fire ?

75
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:10,420
None, you're picking
a healthcare plan.

76
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,815
Ok we'll table that for the time being.
Two, I'm gonna need an office.

77
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:16,297
I think the conference
room should be fine.

78
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:19,253
You can use the conference
room as a temporary workspace.

79
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,840
Yes, I have an office.

80
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,627
- Bigger than his !
- No, you cannot use it.

81
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,759
- Ok I take it back it's a workspace.
- Temporary workspace, you can use it.

82
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:30,006
Thank you.

83
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,401
If Dwight fails and that is
strike too and good for me,

84
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,054
for giving him a second chance.

85
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:40,102
And if he succeeds, then, you know,

86
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:42,634
no one would be prouder than
I am. I've groomed him.

87
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:44,703
I made him what he is today.

88
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,400
Unless he fails and,

89
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,263
talked about that already.

90
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,672
<i>What did I do ? I did my job. </i>

91
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,314
<i>I slashed benefits to the bone.
I saved this company money. </i>

92
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:05,706
<i>Was I too harsh ? Maybe.
I don't believe in coddling people. </i>

93
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:09,282
In the wild, there is no healthcare.

94
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:12,872
In the wild healthcare is
"How, I hurt my leg...

95
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:15,911
I can't run, a lion eats me,
and I'm dead. "

96
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:19,606
Well, I'm not dead.

97
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,133
I'm the lion.

98
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,873
You're dead !

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,027
There's no dental, there's no vision,

100
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:33,381
there is a 1200 dollars deductible.

101
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,069
Dundler Mifflin this is Pam.

102
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:40,461
<i>Pam, Michael Scott, how's tricks ? </i>

103
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:43,442
Where are you ?

104
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:46,645
<i>Oh, I'm in my office, I am swamped. </i>

105
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:49,249
I have work up to my ears

106
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:53,397
and busy busy busy, can't step away,
I just wanted to check in and

107
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:56,522
see how everybody's dealing.
Everybody cool out there ?

108
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,049
Actually, people are really unhappy

109
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,480
Dwight send around this memo

110
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:04,307
<i>- And people are freaking out cause...
- Pam, you, I'm sorry I'm sorry</i>

111
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,718
<i>I, I, I got to go I'm getting a call. </i>

112
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:09,217
No you're not.

113
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,393
I have to make a call
after I finish, my work

114
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:16,181
You know what ?
Don't let anybody in my office

115
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:20,561
Under any conditions today I'm just
too busy, too swamped, you know ?

116
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:24,834
I'm unreachable.
I'm incommunicado capisce ?

117
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:26,155
<i>- Ok
- Thank you,</i>

118
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,946
God here we go again, got to go,
I have to take this.

119
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:31,683
<i>Still no one calling. </i>

120
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,416
- Dwight, what is this...
- Uh, knock, please.

121
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:41,506
- Please knock, this is an office.
- It says workspace.

122
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,142
- Same thing.
- If it's the same thing,

123
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:45,529
then why'd you write "work space".

124
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:49,659
Just knock, please, as a sign of
respect for your superior.

125
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:52,543
- You are not my superior.
- Gee, then why do I have an office ?

126
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:55,253
- Thought it was a workspace, Dwight.
- Ok, Dwight.

127
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,138
Are you really in charge of
picking an healthcare plan ?

128
00:06:58,215 --> 00:06:59,739
Yes. And my decision is final.

129
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,083
This is a ridiculously awful plan.

130
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,408
Because you cut everything.

131
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,730
- Times are tough, Pam, deal with it.
- You cut more than you had to, didn't you ?

132
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,220
Sure.

133
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:11,006
Then why did you do that ? You work
here, don't you want good insurance ?

134
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:13,590
Don't need it, never been sick,
perfect immune system.

135
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:16,919
Ok well if you've never been sick,
then you don't have any antibodies.

136
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,485
I don't need them, superior genes.

137
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:22,369
I'm a Schrute...
And superior brain power.

138
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,958
Through concentration I can raise

139
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,739
Why would you want to
raise your cholesterol ?

140
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,842
So I can lower it.

141
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:35,840
He literally won't
come out of his office.

142
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:38,633
He's got to come out sometime.

143
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,112
- To go to the bathroom.
- Kevin, that's inappropriate !

144
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:50,102
Michael can I talk to you ?

145
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,189
I would like to, but I'm
really busy, rain check ?

146
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:56,122
Michael, Michael please

147
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,533
Can we talk about this memo ?

148
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:01,331
- What ? Which memo ?
- Dwight's healthcare memo

149
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,990
- I told you about it.
- Is it a good plan ?

150
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:05,276
It's a great plan !
It saves the company a fortune.

151
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,344
- It's like a paid decrease.
- Michael, he made huge cuts.

152
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,508
Cuts ? what ?
Dwight did you make cuts ?

153
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:14,672
- Yeah you said go in the...
- No no no no no. You know what ?

154
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:17,517
I said nothing specific
because I was so busy.

155
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:19,977
Why don't you go in there Dwight ?

156
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,402
and find these people a
plan that will work for them. Ok ?

157
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,363
- I can handle it.
- Ok. All right.

158
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,029
We feel good ? All right, good !

159
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,746
Plus,

160
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:37,193
There's some other good news.

161
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:39,723
Today at the end of the day,

162
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,453
I will have for all of you

163
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,205
a big surprise. Ok ?

164
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:49,340
So hang in there, and I will
see you at the end of the day.

165
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,128
Right ?

166
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:01,967
- This is not good.
- It's ridiculous.

167
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,639
Did you talk to him ?

168
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:05,807
What was that ?

169
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:08,150
You let him off all over
you it's just pathetic.

170
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:10,964
- What are you guys talking about ?
- Nothing Kevin.

171
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:14,064
Do I know what the surprise is ?
Hell no !

172
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,315
Doesn't matter, the point is,
they're not unhappy anymore.

173
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:20,469
They're out there thinking "Wow !
My boss really cares about me.

174
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:23,324
He has a surprise, he's cool.

175
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:26,546
What a great guy, I love him.

176
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,221
I love him. "

177
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,929
Ok everyone, gather’ round.

178
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,540
Step forward.

179
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,440
It has been brought to my attention that
some of you are unhappy with my plan,

180
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:45,906
so what I'd like you to do,

181
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:48,559
is to fill this out and write
down any diseases that you have,

182
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,231
That you might want covered
and I'll see what I can do.

183
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,092
Okay you know what Dwight ? We can't
write our diseases down for you,

184
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,881
- because that's confidential.
- Ok,

185
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,389
well I didn't say to write
your name down, did I ?

186
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:00,356
Fill that out, leave it anonymous.

187
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:02,932
Or don't write any disease down at
all, and they won't be covered.

188
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:05,151
Sound fair ? Good. All right,
I'll be in my office.

189
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,254
Workspace.

190
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,389
You know what ? Come with me.

191
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:12,463
We are going on a little mission.

192
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,585
"Operation surprise. "

193
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,279
Where are you going ?

194
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,028
Headed out. Part of my busy day.

195
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:23,403
You know, meetings.

196
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,540
Couldn't find the knock.

197
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,347
So basically, I want to do
something nice for my employees.

198
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:36,019
Atlantic City. Ok ?

199
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:38,855
They have this thing
where they send a bus,

200
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,832
Right for free, picks everybody up,

201
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:43,852
and head down there, get to
the hotel, the room is count.

202
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:46,427
They give you a big pile
of chips, and your food.

203
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:50,840
Everything just kind of a all
inclusive free kind of weekend.

204
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:52,736
I don't know of anything like that.

205
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:56,594
But, you know what you might want to
do is just call the casino directly,

206
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,967
- Maybe.
- Yep yep, yep.

207
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:02,122
I did, so.

208
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:15,511
Wait what are you writing ?

209
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,922
Don't write Ebola, or mad cow disease.

210
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:20,247
All right ?

211
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,581
Cause I'm suffering from both of them.

212
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:25,572
- I'm inventing new diseases.
- Oh great.

213
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,697
So let's say that my
teeth turn to liquid

214
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:31,302
And then, they drip down
the back of my throat.

215
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:32,594
What would you call that ?

216
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,389
I thought you said you
were inventing diseases ?

217
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:36,974
That's spontaneous
"dentohydroplosion"

218
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,675
- Nice.
- Thank you.

219
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:42,154
Calling to ask you a little
favor Rooney my friend.

220
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:46,871
I'm trying to give the troops
around here a little bit of a boost

221
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:48,684
And I was thinking that

222
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:52,408
maybe we could take them down
to take a spin on your big ride.

223
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:56,826
<i>You mean the elevator that
takes you down in the mine shaft ? </i>

224
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,572
<i>It's not really a ride. </i>

225
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,331
It says here that it's a...

226
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:03,713
300 foot drop.

227
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:07,167
<i>Well that goes 300 feet in the
earth but it moves really slowly. </i>

228
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:10,697
So it's not a free fall ?

229
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:13,215
<i>It's a industrial coal elevator. </i>

230
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,729
All right. Once you get
down into the mine,

231
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:21,559
what, you got laser tag or something ?

232
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:24,887
OK ok so I don't know what
the surprise is, am I worried ?

233
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:27,655
Nooo. No way.
You see I thrive on this.

234
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:31,331
This is my world, this is improv,
this it "whose line is it anyway".

235
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:37,383
<i>Damn it ! damn it ! Jim ! </i>

236
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,965
All right, who did this ?

237
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:42,327
I'm not mad, I just want to know
who did it, so I can punish them.

238
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:43,678
What are you talking about ?

239
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:47,594
"Someone", forged medical
information, and that is felony.

240
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:50,990
Ok "wow", cause that is
a pretty intense accusation.

241
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:53,527
How do you know that they're fake ?

242
00:12:53,778 --> 00:12:55,784
Uh, Leprosy ?

243
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:58,765
Flesh eating bacteria.

244
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,784
Hot dog fingers.

245
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:06,028
Government created
killer nano robot infection

246
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:09,308
- You did this didn't you ?
- Absolutely not.

247
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:10,369
- Yes you did.
- No I didn't.

248
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:12,241
I know it was you.
Ok fine, you know what ?

249
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,276
I'm gonna have to interview
each and everyone of you

250
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:17,170
Until the perpetrator
makes him or herself known.

251
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:21,028
And until that time, there will be
no healthcare coverage for anyone.

252
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:29,170
- Killer Nano Robots ?
- It's an epidemic.

253
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:35,517
The problem Jim, is that people
who are really suffering

254
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:38,821
from a medical condition,
won't receive the care they need,

255
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,415
because someone in this office has
coming up with all those ridiculous stuff

256
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:47,961
- "Count Choculitis. ".
- Sounds tough.

257
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:50,481
Why did you write that down Jim ?

258
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,881
- Is it because you know I love Count Chocula ?
- Do you ?

259
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:57,160
I think you need to confess the fact.

260
00:13:57,428 --> 00:13:58,765
- Yeah.
- What are you doing ?

261
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:00,501
- What ?
- Those are my keys.

262
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,901
- Good luck.
- Jim ! Damn it !

263
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:06,868
No ! Jim let me out. Jim, let...

264
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,067
The light green is a green.

265
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:17,785
<i>- Jim Halpert.
- Let me out. </i>

266
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:19,772
<i>- Who is this ?
- Let me out or you're fired. </i>

267
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:22,868
<i>- No, you can't fire me.
- Yes I can, I'm manager for the day. </i>

268
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:24,277
<i>Clean out your desk. </i>

269
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:26,843
Ok, can you hold on one
second, I'm getting a bip.

270
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:31,772
<i>- Jim Halpert.
- Hey Jim, it's Pam. </i>

271
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,251
Hey Pam !
How are you ?

272
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:35,669
- Jim open the door !
- Good. How are you ?

273
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:37,000
- I'm doing ok,
- Busy ?

274
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:38,939
- Getting excited for the week end now.
- Yeah.

275
00:14:38,997 --> 00:14:41,505
- Yeah, what are you up to ?
- I'm not bothering you am I ?

276
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,519
- No not all.
- You don't have anything you're doing.

277
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,062
- I have nothing to do.
- Oh great.

278
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,937
Yeah no, this week end nothing
I'm not really doing anything.

279
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:50,262
- Might go to the mall.
- The mall ?

280
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:53,514
- I need new shoes.
- How interesting, what kind of shoes ?

281
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,151
<i>- Hello ?
- Hello.</i>

282
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,416
This is Dwight Schrute
calling for Jan Levinson-Gould.

283
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,567
<i>This is Jan. </i>

284
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:04,972
Hi, Dwight Schrute calling,
acting manager Scranton branch,

285
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,107
Listen I need your permission
to fire Jim Halpert.

286
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,876
<i>- Who is this ?
- Dwight Schrute.</i>

287
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:13,635
<i>- From sales ?
- Well.</i>

288
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:17,271
<i>- Where is Michael Scott ?
- He is not here right now.</i>

289
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:20,030
He put me in charge of the office.

290
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:23,888
<i>Dwight, listen to me very carefully,
you are not a manager of anything. </i>

291
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:27,342
<i>- Understand ?
- That's not entirely true,</i>

292
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,467
Because he put me in charge
of picking a healthcare plan.

293
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:32,512
<i>- Really ?
- Yeah.</i>

294
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:33,342
<i>Ok. </i>

295
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,705
<i>when Michael gets back, you tell
him to call me immediately. </i>

296
00:15:35,763 --> 00:15:37,056
<i>- Call you immediately, good.
- Yes. </i>

297
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:39,872
Listen, since I have you on the phone,

298
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,577
<i>- Can I fire Jim ?
- No. </i>

299
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,853
<i>Please don't use my
cell phone ever again. </i>

300
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,589
This is your cell, I thought
this was your off...

301
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:58,268
Everybody ice cream sandwiches.

302
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,856
There you go take one
take one it's all good.

303
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:03,920
Phyllis, safe pass.

304
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,026
I see Angela right, Angela !

305
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,155
Hey, temp, why don't you take two.

306
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,946
Because you don't get healthcare,
and faster metabolism.

307
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:17,869
Did you get the kind with
the cookies, instead of the ?

308
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:20,319
Why don't you just eat it ?
Ok.

309
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:23,271
Here you go Stanley the "manly" !

310
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:24,814
- Thanks.
- There you go.

311
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,531
This isn't the big surprise is it ?

312
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,039
Because we've been having
a pretty horrible day.

313
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:31,432
Nope, nope.

314
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:32,985
This isn't the surprise.

315
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:36,149
It's surprising, because
you didn't expect it.

316
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:39,505
But you'll, you'll know
it when you see it.

317
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:43,441
Michael, Michael !

318
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,456
I tried being rational.
Ok, and what happened ?

319
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:01,334
The employees went crazy,
I got no hope from corporate,

320
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,308
so that leaves me with no options.

321
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,810
I'm now gonna read aloud your
submitted medical conditions.

322
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,322
When you hear yours read, please raise
your hand, indicate that it is real

323
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:12,457
If you do not raise your hand,
it will not be covered.

324
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:15,110
- What about confidentiality ?
- You know what ?

325
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:19,449
You have forfeited that privilege.
I have tried to treat you all as adults.

326
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:22,494
But obviously, I'm the only adult here.

327
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,412
Number one, inverted penis.

328
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:35,455
Could you mean vagina ?
Because if you do I want that covered.

329
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,408
I thought your vagina was removed
during you hysterectomy.

330
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,171
A uterus is different from a
vagina. I still have a vagina.

331
00:17:57,554 --> 00:18:01,661
Ok great. "Germatitus".
Thank you Angela,

332
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:07,651
I'll make sure that's covered. Ok now,
who wrote this, this hysterical one ?

333
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:10,704
- Anal fissures.
- That's a real thing.

334
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,076
Yeah but no one here has it.

335
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,348
Someone has it.

336
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:32,092
- Do you think we should go.
- I don't know, Kevin this is important.

337
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:33,385
I don't want futileness.

338
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,884
- What is he doing ?
- I don't know.

339
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:47,753
Well ?

340
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:49,432
Well, what ?

341
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:52,297
- You could be referring to anything.
- Ok,

342
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:53,782
The healthcare plan.

343
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,396
Why did you put Dwight in charge
of that, he did an horrible job.

344
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:58,605
Dwight ?

345
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,162
- Did you raise benefits ?
- I most certainly did not.

346
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:04,017
come on ! That's horrible !

347
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:07,847
Thanks Dwight for a crappy plan.

348
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,345
Damn.

349
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:14,406
I wish I had time to change it, but...

350
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:18,014
Jan needs it by five and...
What time is it ? What time is it ?

351
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:21,014
It's after five.

352
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,782
It's awful.

353
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:26,281
So well, ok.

354
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:29,117
See you guys on Monday.

355
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:31,972
What about the surprise ?

356
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,470
Yes exactly.

357
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:37,538
Thank you Angela
for reminding me.

358
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:40,027
Terrific.

359
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,284
Before I tell everybody
what the big surprise is,

360
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:46,094
would you like to tell me,
what you think the big surprise is ?

361
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,422
We all think you don't have a surprise.

362
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:53,107
All right, I have some news for you.
There is a big surprise.

363
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,322
And... here it is, here we go...

364
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,184
And

365
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:02,174
the big surprise is...

366
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:06,081
Drum roll.

367
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:29,917
<i>When I am backed into a corner,
that is when I come alive. </i>

368
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,544
See I learned improv
from the greats, like...

369
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,457
Drew Carey and Ryan Styles.

370
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:52,258
Robin Williams, oh man, would
I love to go head to head with him.

371
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:56,329
That would be exciting !
"Hi, I'm Mork from Ork. "

372
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:59,136
"Well I'm Bork for Smork".

373
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,055
"anounanouzoubliblublu"

374
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:32,009
Jan wants you to call her.
