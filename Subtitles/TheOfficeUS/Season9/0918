Oh, oh.
She's doing it again.

2
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:09,072
Phyllis has gotten
into audiobooks.

3
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:11,658
And lately she's been listening
to <i>50 Shades Of Grey,</i>

4
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:14,111
which, if you don't know
what it is,

5
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:16,980
- it's a book about, uh, um--
- It's porn.

6
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:18,849
Yeah.

[Chair squeaking]

8
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:22,969
Seriously?

9
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,554
This is unacceptable.

10
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:26,573
It's officially
a hostile work environment.

11
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:27,824
Why?

12
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,109
Somebody just needs
to get her attention,

13
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:30,761
tell her it's not okay
to do this in public.

14
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:32,429
Be careful.
I pulled my mom's dog

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,047
off the pillow once,
and I got bit.

16
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:36,299
Just ignore her.
Sooner or later, she'll finish.

Meredith! Good lord.

18
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:40,704
- What?
- Phyllis is masturbating

19
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:42,922
in the office
right now as we speak.

20
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,409
Can we skip the color
commentary and just have Andy

21
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:47,026
go out there and fire her?

22
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:48,495
He can't do that.

23
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,347
Turns out she's allowed
to have feelings

24
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:51,998
of sexual arousal.

25
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,767
Doesn't become a violation

26
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:55,335
till she physically acts on it.

W-w-wait, wait.
Why is Phyllis so aroused?

She's listening
to<i>50 Shades Of Grey.</i>

Well, there you go.
That's<i>muy caliente.</i>

I'll take care of this.

[Sputters] What the hell?

33
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:15,172
It's okay, guys.
She's no longer horny.

34
00:01:15,223 --> 00:01:17,224
Excuse me, dirty birdie.

35
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:18,658
What?

36
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:21,328
You can have this back
at the end of the day.

Clark, I need your advice.

42
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:38,612
I'm having some lady troubles.

43
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:41,181
- What's her name?
- Esther Bruegger.

44
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:43,550
- Sweet.
- Lives on the neighboring farm.

45
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,018
- 85 acres.
- Oh, yeah.

46
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:46,453
Keep talking.

47

There has been physicality.

49

The thing is, we were hanging
out with her father

the other night,
looking at a farm catalogue,

51

The same thing that you think.

56
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:05,656
Long-term tractor leases can
put pressure on a relationship.

57

God, a lot of my buddies
are going

58

that like that thing.

00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,348
No, no.
Please, yeah.

357
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:56,518
Come on in.

358
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:58,120
Good to see you.
Um, sorry.

359
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,422
My place
is usually not this--

360
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:01,707
Oh, my gosh, please, don't.

361
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,276
Yeah, no, I--
actually, it's always like this.

362
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,095
[Laughter]
You want to go outside?

363
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:07,279
It's a little less cluttered
out there.

364
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,413
- Sure. Yeah.
- Yeah?

365
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,848
Yeah.

366
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,685
[Sighs]

367
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:16,355
- Let me grab a couple drinks.
- Okay.

368
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:18,140
Oh, wow, you have a nice view.

369
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:19,791
All right.

370
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:22,177
- That's for you.
- Oh, thank you.

371
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,663
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

372
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,548
[Radio plays loudly] All right.

373
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,334
How much have you revealed
on camera

374
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,019
about your relationship
with the Senator?

375
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,121
They caught us kissing
on Halloween.

376
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:34,406
[Gasps] He was dressed
like Ronald Reagan!

377
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,158
- Oww!
- God.

378
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,410
Angela! Well, he kissed
like Jack Kennedy.

379
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:40,078
- Oh!
- Stop it.

380
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,196
Stop kissing him.

381
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,598
Someone needs to call
and warn him.

382
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,049
This could ruin his career.

383
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,268
I don't like
giving him bad news.

384
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,553
- Call him!
- You call him!

385
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,271
- Call him! Call him!
- Stop hitting me! No!

386
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,191
- So...
- So...

387
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,859
What brings you by?

388
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:56,512
Well, the promo
for the documentary aired today.

389
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:57,963
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

390
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,648
- It's kind of crazy.
- It is.

391
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:01,550
See all this, like, old stuff.

392
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,720
- I know.
- Like, there's that shot

393
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:07,289
- of Jim and I up on the roof.
- Oh, yeah, that was--

394
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,491
- that was a good moment.
- Yeah, wasn't that neat?

395
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:11,977
- Yeah, that was cool.
- Yeah.

396
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,263
And there's this one
when we were listening

397
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,448
to music,
and it's like--

398
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,633
it's like we were in love,

399
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,834
we didn't even know
we were in love.

400
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:21,670
And it's--

401
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,356
but...

402
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,775
do you think Jim's changed?

403
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,277
- Um...
- I'm sorry.

404
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:29,661
Did that--
but that was out of the blue.

405
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,996
I just mean,
because you know us,

406
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,798
and you've, like, observed us

407
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:36,668
for ten years,
and I feel like he's--

408
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,439
I just feel like he's
so into his work right now,

409
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:42,991
and...

410
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,761
I don't know.
Am I crazy?

411
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,547
No, you're not crazy.

412
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,953
Well, I wish that made me
feel better.

413
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:58,607
Listen, so everybody
saw the promos,

414
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,925
and they're
kind of freaking out.

415
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:01,477
- [Chuckles]
- 'Cause it seems

416
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,946
like you got a lot
of private stuff on camera.

417
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,881
- Yeah.
- You know, stuff people

418
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,866
didn't intend
for everyone to see,

419
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,985
and they kind of want
to know how much.

420
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,720
They want to know
how much what?

421
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,422
How much stuff you got.

422
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,190
Pretty much everything.

423
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,876
Well, yeah, but what if we
turn off our mic packs?

424
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,244
They've got parabolic mics.

425
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,612
They can pick you up
100 yards away.

426
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,016
So, no, if you were
around there, they got you.

427
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,252
So we basically had
no privacy for ten years.

428
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,338
That's not really true.
I mean...

429
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:32,991
- that's--
- Um...

430
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,593
yeah, I gotta go.

431
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:35,627
Oh, no, hang on a second.

432
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,212
Pam, I'm sorry.
I-- I--

433
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,630
I can explain this
so much better.

434
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,832
No, I think you explained it.

435
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,936
Look, if you give me a chance,
I can-- Pam.

436
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,839
"We will win this baseball game

437
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,808
against the Evil Space Yankees.

438
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,209
Eat fresh."

439
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,544
That'll pay
for the exploding helicopter.

440
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,513
- Smart.
- Mm-hmm.

441
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:57,266
"Suddenly, the Evil Thugs
break into the stadium.

442
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,302
The Big Piece hits baseball
at the Evil Thugs."

443
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,354
"Buy me some peanuts
and cracker jacks."

444
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,373
Come on, man.
Sell it.

445
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:07,426
Yeah, Jim.

446
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,611
[Forceful] "Buy me some
peanuts and cracker jacks!"

447
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:10,946
Yeah, that's better.

448
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,864
"A bunch of hot women go,

449
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,149
'oh, yeah.'"

450
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,451
"Megan, I was too shy
to tell you this

451
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:18,654
when I was just a normal
professional baseball player,

452
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,106
but I love you."

453
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,408
"They kiss.
It is super emotional.

454
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,128
- Like in <i>Toy Story."</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

455
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:27,379
I tell you what.
It's really strong.

456
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,131
Can't wait to read
the rest of it later,

457
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:30,999
- see how it ends.
- It's so strong.

458
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,335
Keep reading then.

459
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,837
"Gotta go. Darth Vader's
launching a huge attack."

460
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:38,006
Um, another thing.

461
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,891
I'm gonna need you
to get me the rights

462
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,945
to Darth Vader.

463
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,263
I don't know how we'd
go about doing that, but...

464
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,232
- We can look into it.
- We'll look into it.

465
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,700
We need Darth.

466
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,302
- We gotta get him.
- Go after Darth then.

467
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,970
- We're gonna go get him.
- That's what we're gonna do.

468
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,739
We're gonna go get him.

469
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,774
Maybe you're right.

470
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,025
Esther's a ten,

471
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,777
and the best I've ever done
is Angela,

472
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,696
who's a nine,
and she rejected me.

473
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,448
A Scranton nine,
but, yeah, point taken.

474
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,584
Hey, let's go out tonight

475
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,836
and just score
a couple fours, huh?

476
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,088
I mean, there are no games
with fours.

477
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,673
Who needs a new tractor anyway?

478
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,175
Maybe we're the kind of guys

479
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,377
who end up with a tractor
that's already been rode hard

480
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,712
and put away muddy.

481
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,796
Screw new tractors.

482
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,432
Guys like us,
we got to plant our seed

483
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,267
- a different way.
- By hand.

484
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,469
[Door opens] Dwight.

485
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,138
We need to talk.

486
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,023
I don't know
that there's anything left

487
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:30,359
for us to talk about, Esther.

488
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:32,110
Look, we're gonna have
the tractor for the same amount

489
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,279
of work days, but my dad
is planning on leasing it

490
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,814
to the Vanderkirk brothers
on the weekends.

491
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,366
No.

492
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,117
So you're gonna be
paying more, but he's putting on

493
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,952
ten times the miles,
and he's pocketing a profit

494
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,155
- behind your back.
- That snake!

495
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,990
You need to tell him you want
a deal based on miles,

496
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,191
or he can just stick
that tractor

497
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,859
where the sun don't shine.

498
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,694
That shady grove
out by Willard's pond.

499
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,196
Mm-hmm.

500
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,750
So... you're fine with me
not leasing the tractor?

501
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,469
I mean, our courtship
can proceed?

502
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,087
Of course.

503
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,974
You didn't think I was just
tractor bait, did you?

504
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,210
N-no.
[Laughs]

505
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,728
- That--
- Yeah.

506
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:09,347
Hey, Dwight.
What's an Auger used for?

507
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,066
Post hole digging.

508
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,385
[Laughter]

509
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,737
[Telephone ringing]

510
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:17,739
You've reached
Senator Robert Lipton.

511
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:20,025
Please leave a message.
[Telephone beeps]

512
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,326
- Hi, honey!
- Hey, honey.

513
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
- No, you go.
- Go. No, go ahead.

514
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,395
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, hey, Robert.

515
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,331
- It's Angela and Oscar.
- Hey.

516
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,582
Just a few quick things.

517
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:30,535
Um, the documentary's
going to be airing soon,

518
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,737
and-- and you look great
in the promos.

519
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,706
- Oh, you look so handsome.
- Oh.

520
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,508
Very presidential.

521
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,593
- Very much so. Absolutely.
- Yeah.

522
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,762
Hey, I get the sense
you're gonna be outed as gay.

523
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:43,882
Yes, and I cheated on you
with Dwight.

524
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,467
It looks
like they got it on film.

525
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,853
I didn't tell you about it.

526
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,754
- I think that's it.
- I think we're good.

527
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,107
- Done. Okay.
