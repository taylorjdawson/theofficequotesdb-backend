1
00:00:01,066 --> 00:00:02,185
Have you seen Darryl?

2
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:03,359
He's around here, somewhere.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,863
Hmm.

4
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:07,864
Yeah, Darryl's here.

5
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:09,115
So is Santa Claus.

6
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,584
It's just a regular Thursday.

7
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,169
Neither guy is here.

8
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:14,504
And it's Friday.

9
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:18,508
Welcome to me and Darryl's
World of Lies.

10
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:20,343
Nobody knows it yet,

11
00:00:20,377 --> 00:00:22,212
but Darryl already
started working in Philly.

12
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:24,881
So now he has to sneak
out of here

13
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:27,167
like the sneakiest
little sneaky sneak

14
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:29,385
you ever saw.

15
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,138
And I'm his helper.

16
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:35,558
It's so fun.

17
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:38,728
Darryl, meet Bear-yl.

18
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:40,063
How much did you pay for that?

19
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:42,348
Nothing.
Won him at the carnival.

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,483
Spent a ton on tickets, though.

21
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,018
Drive safe.

22
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:46,886
Everybody knows I go to Philly.

23
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,239
I've just been using sick days
I saved up.

24
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:52,692
But Erin was so excited
about being sneaky sneaks,

25
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,277
I went along with it.

26
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:55,612
[Laughs]

27
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:57,997
Darryl, you are too much.

28
00:00:58,032 --> 00:00:59,199
That guy's hilarious.

29
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,170
He's here today.

30
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:08,258
[Cheerful music]

32
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,381
I've really been putting
in the hours

33
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:16,766
on this mural.

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,351
And my bs
is totally okay with it,

35
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:19,719
because he's in the Bahamas

36
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,639
and has no clue
what anybody's doing.

37
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:24,974
I'm usually very self-critical.
I hate what I paint.

38
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,085
But I don't know.
This time I feel

39
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:29,338
like it's--
it's really coming together.

40
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:31,557
Oh, my God!

41
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,809
What?
You've got to be kidding me.

42
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,146
What-- are those--
are those butts?

43
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,730
Huh?

44
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,315
No way.

45
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,317
No way.

46
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,820
Excuse me, everyone.

47
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,240
Is it okay if I leave early
from work today?

48
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,908
It's Phillip's first birthday,

49
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,993
and the Senator and I
are hosting

50
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,277
a party at our house.

51
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:54,329
Oh, cute, so there'll
be a bunch of kids.

52
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,864
No.
No children.

53
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:57,366
Our house is not kid-friendly.

54
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,954
Most of our furniture is sharp.
Also ew.

55
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:04,590
It will mostly be
campaign donors.

56
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,343
Angela, I am prepared to donate

57
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:13,432
a whopping $8
to Lipton for America

58
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,467
- to have an invitation--
- No, no, please.

59
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:18,470
You know, actually none of you
could even really make the cut

60
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:19,771
for this thing.

61
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:24,309
Which I am so sad about.

62
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,345
Angela.

63
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,313
You're going to find out,
so I thought

64
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:33,318
I'd let you know
that Robert invited me too.

65
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,571
- What?
- He said he wanted me there

66
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:37,239
- for support.
- I'm...

67
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:39,625
his wife.

68
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,044
Angela's husband
and I are in love,

69
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,879
but as a politician
in this town

70
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,947
you still need
the conventional blonde wife

71
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,499
on your lawn signs.

72
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,504
He is risking everything
to have me there today.

73
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:54,089
Me.

74
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:56,308
We agreed
that you wouldn't be seen

75
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,560
with him in public.

76
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,846
It's humiliating for me.

77
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:04,399
Well, if you get
to bring a stud,

78
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,184
maybe I do too.

79
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,690
- Hey.
- Hey.

80
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,825
We are splitting a sublet
on a place near Philly.

81
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,528
Just a couple
of grown, sexy ass roommates.

82
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,080
And, as much as I miss
Pam and the kids,

83
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,915
it's kind of nice
to live the bachelor life again.

84
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,166
You know, let your hair down.

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,869
Jim was nice enough
to give me his bedroom.

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,087
I'm couching it.

87
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,838
Which usually means
there are clothes

88
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,457
all over the living room.

89

And this dude labels his food.

90

He's the clean one.
I'm the messy one.

91
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,296
How much fun is this?

92
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,517
I love Jim.
I love that he hooked me up

93
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,685
with a job.

94
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,187
It's just he uses
old T-shirts

95
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,939
as wash rags.

96
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,190
He doesn't wash his dishes.

97
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:49,511
Apparently,
they need to "soak."

Can I have your attention,
please?

Yeah, I don't know
everybody's name down here,

will you please raise your hand?

Hello?

This is not over.

Okay?

00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,970
I will stay up here all day
if I have to.

108

Is that what you want?

109
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,984
Yeah, I will also come down
if I want to.

110
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,269
It's my choice.

111
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:33,772
I don't demand justice often.

over this, right?

Andy's gone. Jim's out.

like I'm on my own here.

not completely on my own,

who can do something.

to gather everyone

to talk about stuff
that's gonna be revealed

once we're in the conference
room for the meeting.

meeting?

They painted all over it.

145
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,327
I thought
that's what you were doing.

146
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:58,495
Yeah, but this is different.

147
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:01,031
Oh. They used worse paint
than your paint.

148
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:03,250
I don't think so,
but they put paint

149
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:04,534
where I didn't want paint,
so...

150
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,286
I thought you wanted paint
on the whole thing.

151
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:09,373
Different-colored paint.
I wanted different-colored paint

152
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,757
in the spots where they put
their paints,

153
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:12,409
so it just is-- okay.

154
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:15,429
The point is these
warehouse guys are vandals,

155
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:17,080
and they need to be stopped.

156
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:19,582
Yeah, and somebody had
the balls to put my phone number

157
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,601
on the men's room wall,
which is so messed up.

158
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:24,921
It's 6782, not 83.

159
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:28,608
Uh, 6783's also a good time,
less mileage.

160
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:29,926
Pam, what can be done?

161
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:32,429
Yes, thank you.
Let's answer that question.

162
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,698
I was politely saying
nothing can be done.

163
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:37,234
- I thought I was clear.
- What?

164
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:38,768
Come on, guys,
we need to figure out

165
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:40,620
who did this and punish them.

166
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:42,155
This isn't just about me.

167
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:44,124
This is about all of us.

168
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:45,492
This is our mural.

169
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:48,879
Don't you see
how much we worked on this?

170
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:50,497
How much time and energy?

171
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:52,782
We put our heart
and soul into this thing.

172
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,284
David Wallace
called this meeting?

173
00:06:54,302 --> 00:06:56,586
Sure did.
I was as surprised as you,

174
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,622
but apparently he is very
passionate about public art.

[Overlapping groans]

176
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:03,960
No, no, come on, guys.
Don't go.

00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:06,847
- Pam, I'll help you.
- You will?

178
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:08,432
If there's anything
I hate worse than art,

179
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:09,850
it's crime.

- I am in too, Pam.

00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:13,186
- Yeah?
- Yes, of course.

182
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:15,739
I believe in you.
I believe in your art.

183
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:18,975
- And I am bored.
- Great.

184
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:20,510
I was hoping
for a righteous mob.

185
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:22,763
I ended up
with Dwight and Nellie.

186
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:24,881
But they both have
a mob mentality,

187
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,919
and I'm pretty sure Dwight
has a pitchfork in his car.

188
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:32,289
You need my pitchfork?

189
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:33,957
[Exhales]

190
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:36,376
- Hey.
- What is it?

191
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:37,761
I have vengeance to exact.

192
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:39,796
Exciting news.
There's room for one more

193
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,264
at my son's birthday event,

194
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:44,437
- and I want you.
- I'm not interested.

195
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:46,803
But, wait, the State
Transportation Secretary

196
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:47,854
will be there.

197
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,356
You could sell
your bit salt idea

198
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,724
to the highway people.
[Gasps]

199
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:52,943
If I get the deicing gig,
it's gonna be on merit,

200
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:54,811
not because I played politics.

201
00:07:56,731 --> 00:08:00,016
Hey, so a little birdie
just told me

202
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:02,519
that Dwight can't come
to your son's birthday.

203
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:04,738
So do you want me
to go with you?

204
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:06,689
- No.
- Okay, I understand.

205
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:08,158
I'll just stay here then,

206
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:10,243
alone with the money.

207
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:13,079
Oh, crap.

208
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,916
I am handing out pieces
of paper

209
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:18,835
on which you will draw
one human butt.

210
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,086
What I do with said drawings

211
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:21,755
is no one's business
but my own.

212
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:24,090
You're gonna compare 'em
to the butts up there.

213
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,725
Incorrect.
It is my fetish.

214
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,010
Oh, also sign them.

215
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,062
My fetish
is signed drawings of butts.

216
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm not drawing a butt.

217
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:32,399
All right, then no bottoms.

218
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:36,152
We should ask you
to do big rounded Ws.

219
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:37,854
Yes.
Or nipple-less breasts.

220
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:39,906
Okay, okay, I think it's time
to get back to work.

221
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:41,074
Come on, fellas.
Let's go.

222
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,242
Or melons like cantaloupes

223
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:44,411
with the halves are cut off

224
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:46,413
and then just the bottom parts.

225
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,248
Well, this is getting us
nowhere.

226
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:50,000
We need another approach.

227
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,735
We need to find the weakest one

228
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:55,738
and separate him from the group.

229
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:57,907
Yeah, I think,
if we could get Nate alone,

230
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:00,460
we could crack him.

231
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,744
We just need
a pretense to talk to him.

232
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:03,797
We could tell him
that his mother is dying.

233
00:09:03,848 --> 00:09:05,015
That usually works on him.

234
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,683
Nate!

235
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:10,270
Your mother is dying.

236
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:16,476
See, I feel bad about that.

237
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:17,760
It's all right.
It's all right.

238
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:20,981
So she's gonna pull through
again?

239
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:23,366
That's great.
Can I talk to her?

240
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,767
No.
She needs her rest again.

241
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:27,437
Now, listen,
now that we have got you here,

242
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,105
let's talk
about this mural business.

243
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:30,540
You know who the vandal is.

244
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:33,209
Now I know a lot of these
warehouse guys are your friends,

245
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:35,512
but we've got chewing gum.

246
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:38,348
Gum's gotten mintier lately.
Have you noticed?

247
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:40,901
Like, some of it's
just too minty.

248
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:42,736
It's like they're literally
trying to hurt your--

249
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,487
Tell us who defaced the mural.

250
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:48,408
He did it.

251
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:51,278
All right. You can go.
Give him his gum.

252
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,246
There's no gum.
There never was any gum.

253
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:57,450
Wow, that's really rude.

254
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:01,621
[Indistinct chatter,
soft piano music]

255
00:10:01,672 --> 00:10:03,906
Opening with puff pastries?

256
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:05,425
That's a bold play.

257
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,595
They're saying it's only
gonna get better from here?

258
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,765
Good luck.

259
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,767
That painting is just...

260
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:16,002
How can anyone that weighs less
than a Guinea hen

261
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,304
be so terrifying?

262
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:18,838
Ladies and gentlemen,

263
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:21,057
Senator and Angela Lipton.

264
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,559
[Applause]

265
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:24,177
Thanks, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

266
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:26,813
Phillip had no idea
he was so popular.

267
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:29,316
[Laughter]

268
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,068
Oh, Robert, you're horrible.

269
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:33,937
Simon, Maxine,
who let you guys in here?

270
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,905
[Laughter]

271
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,608
This is the team.

272
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:42,078
- Nice job, man.
- You too, Darryl.

273
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:44,914
What?

274
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:47,033
Oh, man.

275
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:48,335
I'm sorry about that.

276
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,503
It's cool.
Reading's tricky sometimes.

277
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:53,456
Oh.
Are you really mad about this?

278
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,126
That's my go-to thermos,
that's all.

279
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,044
Oh.
It's your go-to--

280
00:10:58,095 --> 00:10:59,346
oh, man, that's a bummer.

281
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,764
- I'm sorry about that.
- No big deal.

282
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:01,831
- No big deal.
- No, no, if it's a big deal,

283
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:03,717
it's a big deal.
No big deal.

284
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:05,301
No, no, no, no,
you don't have to do that.

285
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:09,155
Honestly, I don't mind.

286
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:20,533
Did you want me
to wash it for you or...?

287
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:22,068
I don't know.
Are you gonna wash it,

288
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,686
or are you gonna let it soak?

289
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,626
Okay.

290
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,710
[Picks up piece of paper]

291
00:11:30,745 --> 00:11:32,128
Here you go.

292
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:33,830
Thank you.

293
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:38,097
So, Frank, do you have
any thoughts

294
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:43,125
About what was done?
By you?

295
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,294
Maybe-- maybe I could get
the ball rolling.

296
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:47,412
Frank?

297
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:48,847
Hi.

298
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:50,849
Pam.
I am so sorry

299
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:54,019
if I've done anything

300
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:55,420
to offend you.

301
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:57,890
I'm sure it isn't easy
for you guys

302
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:01,626
to have an upstairs person
coming down in your space.

303
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:05,180
So truly I apologize.

304
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,099
But enough about me.

305
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:10,152
Your turn.

306
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,359
Insert apology here, Frank?

307
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,496
I'm sorry I didn't like
your crappy doodles.

308
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,581
I drew a butt.

309
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,199
Big deal.
Butts are funny.

310
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,919
Well, I didn't think
that butt was funny.

311
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:28,537
Well, maybe if you got
the stick out of yours.

312
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:30,372
- What was that?
- You know what?

313
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,541
You people can't fire me,

314
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:34,659
so screw you.

315
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:36,678
[An object falls]

316
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,663
Whoa.

317
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,498
Hey, that is not okay.

318
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:41,833
What are you gonna do
about that?

319
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:44,219
[Speaks indistinctly]

320
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,104
The first sorry
sounded sincere.

321
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,006
There were
two or three sorries in there.

322
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,508
- Mm, that's quite a lot.
- It's a lot.

323
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:52,945
That sucked.

324
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:55,197
He didn't apologize.
There's no talking to that guy.

325
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:57,616
Oh, your little feelings party
didn't work out, huh?

326
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,818
Who won the hugging contest?
No, let me guess.

327
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:01,370
Everyone tied for first.

328
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:02,687
We should just take him down.

329
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:05,207
Wait.
Are you saying...

330
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:07,459
I'm saying we should go
scorched earth

331
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:11,230
on that guy's face.

332
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:13,398
Normally I find Pam
to be a comforting

333
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,050
if unarousing presence
around the office.

334
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:17,419
Like a well-watered fern.

335
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:21,423
But today she has tapped into
this vengeful violent side,

336
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:26,979
and I'm like, wow,
Pam has kind of a good butt.

337
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,314
He messed with something
that was important to you.

338
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:31,216
We need to mess with something
that's important to him.

339
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,685
- A little eye-for-an-eye action.
- Yes, yes.

340
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:35,654
Go all Hammurabi on this clown.

341
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:37,656
We need an infiltrator.

342
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:44,062
I know just the man
for the job.

343
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,914
Clark?

344
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,500
He even looks like a mole.

345
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:51,119
One of his tee shots can wipe
out a whole owl population.

346
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,071
[Laughter]

347
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:55,573
You two seem very close.

348
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:57,426
Yes, we're good friends.
Good friends.

349
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,294
- Yeah.
- And I suppose that may ruffle

350
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:01,930
a few feathers,
because for a long time

351
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:07,219
our party has turned its back
on the Hispanic people.

352
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:08,437
Well, that is not who I am.

353
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:11,857
I am a friend
of the Latino community.

354
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:13,475
And, if you ask me,

355
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:16,094
it's time that we bid bigotry

356
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,362

357
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:20,866
Now does my embrace of Hispanics

358
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,201
make me more electable?

359
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:24,953
Given demographic trends,
I don't know.

360
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,104
And I don't care.

361
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:29,207
What I care about is Oscar.

362
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:32,744
My friend.

364
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:39,301
Maybe I should be insulted
that he only invited me here

365
00:14:39,335 --> 00:14:41,003
to be his token Mexican friend,

366
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,304
but he could have invited

367
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:44,723
any number of Hispanics
that he knows--

368
00:14:44,757 --> 00:14:47,059
his gardener Rohelio,

369
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:49,177
or he could have invited...

370
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:50,429
Rohelio.

371
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:53,932
But he chose me.

372
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:57,469
Rohelio's Malaysian.

The son of a bitch

374
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,361
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

375
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:08,664
Hey, I usually watch TV
during my lunch break.

376
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:10,282
- It's cool?
- Yeah, cool.

377
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:18,757
It's mine.
Don't worry.

378
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,292
I didn't say anything.

379
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:21,677
I don't think you had to.

380
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:23,261
Excuse me?

381
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:24,930
I think you might be going
a little crazy

382
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:26,831
with this labeling thing, man.

383
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:30,602
I mean, you put your name
on a five-pound bag of flour.

384
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,337
Are you honestly saying that,
if I needed flour,

385
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:33,388
I couldn't use that?

386
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:34,773
What you need flour for, Jim?

387
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:36,208
That's not the point.

388
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:38,360
- What you making, bread?
- No, I'm not making bread.

389
00:15:38,394 --> 00:15:40,045
What kind of bread you making?
Pumpernickel?

390
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,563
It doesn't matter.
Darryl, I think you know

391
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:44,199
the point I'm trying to make.

392
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,035
All right, I'm being a jerk.

393
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,906
You got me this job.
I should be grateful.

394
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:53,658
I am, but just, you know, I get
a little finicky about my stuff.

395
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:56,011
That's all.

396
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:58,696
It's all good.

397
00:15:58,715 --> 00:16:00,215
Are we all good?

398
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:03,635
We good.

399
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,203
What's that cooler?

400
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:07,723
Nothing.
It's mine.

What happened
to my <i>Tavis Smileys?</i>

406
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,151
Oh, crap.
Were those yours?

407
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:20,769
I never want to see you working

408
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,604
in the upstairs office again!

409
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:24,573
Do you hear me?

410
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,743
But my only crime was loving
the local sports teams

411
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:29,227
and trying to be
one of the guys.

412
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:30,395
Silence.

413
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:32,080
You'll now be working
in the warehouse

414
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,633
with the untouchables.

415
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:37,202
Now go make your hands
rough with work.

416
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:39,921
Okay, boss.

Pam, you know
this is ridiculous, right?

418
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,675
- Like, you're smarter than him.
- Shh, shh, shh.

419
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,210
- This is never gonna work.
- Shh, shh.

420
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:46,378
Remember your lines.

421
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:48,413
- What lines?
- Go move some paper.

422

Hey, you know that guy Frank

who works in the warehouse?

424
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:53,705
He's not my hire,
but I know who he is.

425
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:54,739
Okay, what is he like?

426
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:55,874
What's important to him?

427
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,209
Does he have, like,
a favorite pair of boots

428
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:58,543
or a lunchbox?

429
00:16:58,578 --> 00:16:59,761
What, is he retiring?

430
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:00,796
You getting him a gift
or something?

431
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,297
Yeah, something like that.

432
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,582
I know he loves
his pickup truck.

Oh, great, his truck.

434
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:06,001
Great. Get the plate number.

Okay, do you know the plate--
never mind.

436
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:08,786
Why would you know that,

437
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:09,971
and why would I be asking that?

438
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:11,590
So we know which truck to fill.

- Yeah.

to step a little closer
to the Senator as well.

00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:37,582
- Somewhere there.
- He's blocking me.

453
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:38,750
It's only a photo, honey.

454
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:40,001
Excuse me.
What's your name?

00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,670
- Shawn.
- Lashawn, great.

You want to be in a photo?
Right this way.

- Not you. No.
- He put me here.

458
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,824
He put you
right in front of me?

459
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:48,260
He placed me there. He did.
He placed me here.

- Here. - Oscar... Angela.

is that supposed
to be my mural?

This is amazing!

Frank, and he's leaving a trail
of poops?

474
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:25,029
- Yeah.
- And he has saggy boobs.

475
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,365

I'm glad you feel better.

00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,370
This has been a wonderful day.

480
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:33,838
I have to say,

481
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:35,707
I like hanging out
with a vengeful bitch.

Ugh, don't sympathize.

the most fitting way possible.

Well...

Yes.
Sorry about that.

507
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,693
It was all my fault.

00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:33,281
Thank you for the food.

511
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:36,234
And also you suck.

512
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:38,370
I beg your pardon.

513
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:41,039
You're, like,
a terrible person.

Well, I'm gonna say something
to the producers.

518
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:01,643
- No, no, it's--
- You shouldn't be fired.

519
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:03,762
I mean,
you were just protecting me.

520
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:06,231
It's all good.
I knew what I was doing. It's...

521
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:07,349
I'm sorry
about your mural, though.

522
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,484
I mean, because you put
so much into that.

523
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:10,852
Oh, no, forget about my mural.
It's stupid.

524
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:11,987
No, you worked hard on that.

526
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:15,973
I'm glad they're firing him too.

00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:17,692
It's crazy.

00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:19,644
Brian, I'm so sorry.

529
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:25,500
Look, I don't-- I don't want to
put myself where I don't belong.

530
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:27,786
If you ever need me,
you just call me,

531
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,822

00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:54,362
Wow, this whole Philly thing
has been so much fun

535
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:58,033
that I may have lost sight
of what really matters.

536
00:20:58,067 --> 00:20:59,984
I mean, having fun
is not nearly as important

537
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:02,370
as being good to the people
you really care about.

538
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:05,373
I mean,
that's just Roommates 101.

539
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:07,191
- Oh, come on.
- Oh.

540
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:08,460
- Uh.
- Oh!

541
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:09,911
Damn.

542
00:21:09,962 --> 00:21:11,913
You wins.

543
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:14,966

544
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,836
How good did that feel?

545
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:21,130
It felt really good actually.
