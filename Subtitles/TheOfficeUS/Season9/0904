1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:03,679
All right, everybody.
Great season of softball,

2
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:05,143
I'm super proud of you, guys.

3
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,827
And I think you're
gonna like this

4
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:08,914
little highlight reel
that I've put together.

5
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:11,285
Dunder Mifflin!

6
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:12,840
Andy Bernard presents...

7
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:15,284
Summer Softball, epic fails!

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,305
Fail.

9
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:19,739
Fail.

10
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,374
- That's me.
- Fail.

11
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:23,076
Is this like a blooper reel?

12
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:25,679
A blooper reel?
What is this, 2005?

13
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:27,581
Do I look like Bob Saget?

14
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,849
Fail!

15
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,052
Who's this guy?

16
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:33,920
♪ Meow, meow, meow, meow
meow, meow, meow, meow ♪

17
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:35,655
Look at him dance.
Fail!

18
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:36,690
Fail.

19
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,325
I deserve that.

20
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:40,860
♪ Doont-de-doont-de-doont,
doont-de-doont-de-doont ♪

21
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:42,229
That was a triple.

22
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:44,998
Can't take the fail?
Get out of the fail video!

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,999
My pleasure.

24
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,734
Hi, I'm Pete.

25
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:50,036
Puberty is such a drag, man.

26
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:53,373
And I'm Clark.
I like to eat toilet paper.

27
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,008
We fail.

28
00:00:56,477 --> 00:00:59,079
I'd like to take a solemn moment
to remember Jerry,

29
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,348
in the warehouse,
who passed away this year.

30
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:08,288
Well, that's all, folks.

31
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,223
Ski you later, everybody.

32
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,925
Thanks for a great season.

33
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:13,760
What was that?

34
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:16,563
That was just normal video
with you making vulgar noises.

35
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:18,431
Well, I worked
with what I had, Oscar.

36
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:22,535
Next time,
do more fail-ier stuff, okay?

37
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:23,770
What happened
to that video I sent you?

38
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:26,039
Oh, that wasn't--
that didn't work.

39
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,107
That was...
not the right thing.

40
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:28,174
- Wait, let's see it.
- Play it.

41
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:30,877
- I think I got it right here.
- No--

42
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:39,452
Oh!

43
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:41,821
Forgot about this.

44
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:44,557
That was not a fail.

45
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,660
That was actually
a serious accident

46
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:48,061
that could've resulted
in severe bodily harm.

47
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:49,963
- Fail, fail, fail.
- You're all failing right now.

48
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:52,132
Congratulations
on your epic fail

49
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:54,267
of the use of the word fail.

51
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:09,449
Oh, God.

52
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:10,717
What's going on?

53
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,819
Nothing, nothing is going on.
Keep moving, please.

54
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,154
What's he measuring?

55
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:16,289
Okay, excuse me,
I'm the landlord.

56
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,524
This is between me
and the management,

57
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:18,825
no one else, please.

58
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:20,427
It's an EMF hotspot.

59
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:21,828
Oh, my God!

60
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,364
It stands for electromagnetic
fields generally caused

61
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,666
by a concentration of wiring
in one area,

62
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,768
especially if poorly insulated.

63
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,503
Dwight?

64
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:33,740
Um, okay,
I'm just walking into this.

65
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:36,643
Am I to understand
there's a beehive in the wall?

66
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:39,512
You think I have a machine
for measuring beehives?

67
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:41,214
I was just asking
a question, Toby.

68
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:42,682
How are you not murdered
every hour?

69
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:45,885
Well, I'm not getting paid
to work in a microwave oven.

70
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:49,689
Okay, listen,
everything here is up to code.

71
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,392
Oh, the wires need insulation.

72
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:55,762
It's a wire, people.
I'm not buying it a fur coat.

73
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,835
- Thank you.
- You got it.

74
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:05,138
Last week, I finally told Pam
about the other job

75
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,307
- I took in Philly, the side job.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:11,010
And she was
so incredibly cool about it.

77
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:15,115
And now, I just want to do
something huge for her.

78
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:17,283
Like if we were
in some biker bar,

79
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:18,818
and she mouthed off
to some bikers,

80
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,721
and they came lumbering over,
and I was like, "wham!

81
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:24,157
Gotta go through me first."

82
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,666
Andy, could I have a word,
please?

83
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,268
Um, it won't take a moment.

84
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,836
It's extremely important,

85
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,872
and it really has
to happen now.

86
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:41,441
Fine, I will give you
one minute--

87
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:43,243
Oh, please, don't use
the hourglass.

88
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:45,412
You have one minute,
and your minute has begun,

89
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,714
and no time will be added
at the end,

90
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:49,582
even to accommodate
this sentence

91
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:52,485
with all of its
baroque-dependent clauses

92
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:56,489
and cascading turns of phrase.

93
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:58,324
I'm trying to adopt a baby.

94
00:03:58,326 --> 00:04:01,694
A baby what?
A human?

95
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:04,564
And the agency require
character reference

96
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:05,598
from my employer.

97
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,933
Oh.

98
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,168
You won't have to do anything.

99
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,169
I would write
the letter myself.

100
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:11,271
You'd just need
to sign it, so--

101
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:17,043
Okay, and fall right into your
plagiarism-entrapment scheme?

102
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:19,446
- I don't think so.
- It's not--

103
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:22,282
And I happen to notice you're
down to about 30 seconds here.

104
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:23,650
Well, then, if I could just
convince you that you--

105
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:26,052
And those sand grains
are tumbling with fury down--

106
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:28,555
It's not entrapment
if I'm writing--

107
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:29,923
Time's up!

108
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:32,025
Fine.

109
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:33,493
Sure, I'll read her letter,

110
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:35,361
and if she tells the truth

111
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:38,064
about how evil and unfit
to be a mother she is,

112
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:40,300
then, yeah, I'll sign that.

113
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:43,670
"Statistical correlations
exist between EMF radiation

114
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:46,105
and various health hazards,

115
00:04:46,107 --> 00:04:49,409
but mainstream studies
are inconclusive."

116
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:52,045
That means
you can't make me do squat.

117
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,046
You better fix this.

118
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:54,280
I already ditched my uterus,

119
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:56,182
and I ain't losing
any more good parts.

120
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:57,851
You people don't realize
what you're asking.

121
00:04:57,853 --> 00:04:59,652
I'd have to rip open the walls.

122
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:03,056
I'd have to shut this place down
for a week.

123
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:05,191
Week off.
That'd be great.

124
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:18,338
Hey, if you don't want
to teach me PowerPoint,

125
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,539
just say so.

126
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,673
I don't want
to teach you PowerPoint.

127
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:22,942
Come on.
Just show me PowerPoint.

128
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:25,111
- Just do the tutorial.
- You're the tutorial.

129
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:27,714
No, dude, I'm not.
I'm not the tutorial.

130
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:28,715
- You could be.
- Mm-mm.

131
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,353
What are you doing?

132
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,021
Getting my wife a week off
from work.

133
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:37,090
You popped one kernel.

134
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:41,327
Awesome, right?

135
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:43,329
So creed
is that dude's stepdad?

136
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,331
Correct.

137
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,501
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you,

138
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:51,204
but I'm just going to say it;
I'm nervous.

139
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:53,206
I have no idea
what health problems

140
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,641
this is all going to cause.

141
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:55,909
- He's right.
- What? Come on.

142
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,210
I'm getting older.
I'm losing my hair.

143
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:58,845
- I'm sorry.
- I'm gonna grow a third arm.

144
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:00,613
I know what Jim
is trying to do.

145
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:01,848
He's trying to get
big, bad Dwight

146
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,650
to shell out
for a huge repair job,

147
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:05,885
while Lucky Jimbo gets
a paid vacation.

148
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,654
Well, sorry, Lucky Jimbo,

149
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:10,023
I can live very happily
in a magnetic field.

150
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:13,059
Most of my childhood heroes
got their powers that way.

151
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:16,029
Side effects of EMF
include headaches--

152
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:17,463
Had them all my life.

153
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,198
Breast pain--

154
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,701
No nobbies, no probbies.
Nice try, Jim.

155
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:23,269
Oof.
Infertility.

156
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:27,340
Yeah, right.

157
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:38,117
Ah, there's my popcorn.
Can you just grab that for me?

158
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:41,621
Keep your snacks
on your side, Jim, idiot.

159
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:45,425
- What the--?
- What?

160
00:06:45,427 --> 00:06:46,960
Some of these kernels
have crowned.

161
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:51,698
That's impossible
'cause that's a brand-new bag.

162
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,534
Oh, my God.

163
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:58,271
Andy!

164
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:03,476
I'm going to drive you
up to the lake,

165
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:04,811
give you a whole week
on the water,

166
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,713
just you, me, and the kids.

167
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:08,648
Oh, can we stop
by that pie stand on the way?

168
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,484
You mean, "Laverne's Pies,
Tires Fixed Also"? Yes.

169
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:13,386
We will be doing that,
and we'll be getting a dozen.

170
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:15,622
A dozen different pies?
'Cause that means rhubarb.

171
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:16,623
Why would you say that?

172
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,091
I meant four apple,
four blueberry,

173
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:19,592
two cherry, one peach,
one chocolate.

174
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:21,027
I thought that was implied.

175
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,462
Yeah, okay, then.

176
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:24,864
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have heard your complaints,

177
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:26,933
and we reached a settlement.

178
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:28,234
So...

179
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:30,937
We will be leaving the office
for one whole week.

180
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:32,472
Nice job.

181
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:34,941
In my contract,
it is stipulated

182
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,976
that I provide
a temporary work space.

183
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,578
It will arrive in one hour.

184
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,079
What?

185
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:41,414
- What's this?
- Oh!

186
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,282
- What?
- Bring it in.

187
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:45,985
Roll into the future
with work bus.

188
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,621
Say good-bye
to wasteful buildings.

189
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:49,922
These days, a mobile office

190
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:51,958
isn't just
for hotshot politicians.

191
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,459
Now anyone can rent a work bus.

192
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:54,927
If you've got a parking lot,

193
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:57,864
a work space is just
a phone call away.

194
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:59,098
In this age

195
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,300
of belt-tightening
and less-empowered workers,

196
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:02,301
a work bus

197
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,439
is how tomorrow
gets things done.

198
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:11,658
- Shh!
- Shh!

199
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,692
Shh!
$23.99 a page, yes.

200
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:14,527
- Six. Yes.
- Yeah.

201
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:15,562
Oh, sorry about that.

202
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:16,596
Oh, my God!

203
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:18,431
Oops. Sorry.

204
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:19,999
Lose weight.

205
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,168
I'm trying.
Sorry.

206
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,106
Ah.

207
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,674
The Pennsylvania Department
of Public Welfare

208
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,242
pre-adoption standard?

209
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:31,845
Oh, of course,
you were adopted.

210
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,013
I wish.

211
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:37,417
No, I made some short lists,
I had a couple of sleepovers,

212
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,587
but I never managed to get
in the end-zone.

213
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:42,822
I don't know what it was.

214
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:44,391
Not lovable, maybe?

215
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:45,592
Oh, well.

216
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:47,761
Listen, I'm really struggling
with this form.

217
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:50,263
But as you know the system,
do you think maybe you could--

218
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:52,532
Absolutely, I know exactly
what they want to hear.

219
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:53,733
I would--
I would love to help.

220
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:56,469
Oh, thank you so much.

221
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:58,638
Just don't tell Andy because--

222
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,639
- He hates me.
- And--

223
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:00,974
- Thinks I'm a monster.
- That--

224
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:03,543
- Should go back to Loch Ness.

225
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:06,880
Stretch.
All right.

226
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:09,616
How many times do you need
to take a stroll?

227
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:13,086
I-- my legs cramp up, okay?
It's a circulation issue.

228
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:14,587
Boy, I will hammer-spank
your rear.

229
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:16,156
All right, all right, gang.

230
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:17,991
Let's just settle down.
You're yelling in her face.

231
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:19,459
It's a medical thing.

232
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,760
Just-- You good?

233
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:23,496
I'm good. I--

234
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,665
I'm so sorry for all of this.

235
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,967
It's okay.

236
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:31,137
You know what they say,
a change is as good as a rest.

237
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,139
I-- I need to get
to the paper, please.

238
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:34,140
Sorry.

239
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:35,275
Oh, God!

240
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:36,576
- Oh, oh, my God!
- Okay--

241
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:38,077
- Oh!
- I'll get you a napkin.

242
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,546
Can someone get napkins,
please?

243
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:41,714
You know what, it's fine.
It's fine, let me just--

244
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:42,715
It's fine.

245
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:46,152
Pam, I'm really sorry.
I just--

246
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:48,154
I'm-- I'm really sorry
about all that.

247
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,193
Really?
Smirking?

248
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:55,995
What can I say?
I love justice.

249
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:58,398
You forced me to spend money
on needless repairs,

250
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,433
and now you're locked
in a prison bus,

251
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:02,368
and your woman drips
with beverage.

252
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,537
Hey, Dwight, I was trying
to do something nice for Pam.

253
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,473
Can you just help me out?

254
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,675
Can we maybe take
this thing somewhere,

255
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:10,844
or do something to not make this
the worst day ever?

256
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:13,813
It's not my responsibility
to solve your marriage problems

257
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:17,183
by spending my money on gas.

258
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,587
Andy!

259
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,021
Yo!
Toonces.

260
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:23,456
You're the boss.

261
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,457
Don't you think we'd all be
a lot more productive

262
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:25,458
if while we were doing work,

263
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,826
we looked up and saw

264
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:28,795
the best rural pie stand
in Pennsylvania?

265
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:31,231
Ooh, I know
I'd be more productive.

266
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,566
- As would I.
- No question.

267
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:35,735
No! No!
This is a work bus.

268
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:38,037
The wheels are for transporting
the work space

269
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,572
to and from the work site.

270
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:40,840
What are you talking about?

271
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:43,443
You're not the boss, Andy is.
Andy?

272
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:47,347
Pies, pies, pies,
pies, pies, pies.

273
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:52,018
All right!
The fat people have spoken.

274
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,254
Dwight, get this bus moving.

275
00:10:57,058 --> 00:11:00,627
Next stop, Laverne's Pies,
Tires Fixed Also.

276
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:02,862
Oh, yes!

277
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:06,799
Yeah, Jim!

278
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,234
So it looks like this work bus

279
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:10,937
was a pretty good idea
after all, huh?

280
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,872
Get your foot
behind the yellow line.

281
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:14,874
You got it.

282
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:17,644
Yeah, Jim!

283
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,288
- Stop.
- Come back.

284
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,956
- Too late.
- Mm.

Playing a little hooky
from work today.

303
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,640
Oh, my God.

304
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:24,143
Dunder Mifflin road trip 2012!

305
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:27,680
Okay, now a serious one.

306
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:29,549
Hey, where's Dwight?
He should be a part of this.

307
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,953
Has he been acting
kind of weird to you lately?

308
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,623
If by "lately," you mean
for the last 12 years, yeah.

309
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,491
No, I mean, he's sulking.
That's not like him.

310
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:40,126
He's just mad
that we're all having fun.

311
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:43,062
Then why isn't he scheming
or preparing to avenge?

312
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:47,567
He's fine.
He's indestructible.

313
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,871
Always say that a child
is placed for adoption,

314
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:54,140
never surrendered.

315
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:55,775
We're not hostages.

316
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:58,811
Although I have
considered kidnapping one.

317
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:02,849
Oh, and never say that.

318
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:05,718
I am so excited
thinking about this child

319
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,053
you're going to adopt.

320
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:08,688
I wish I could just wave
a magic wand

321
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,157
and make you a parentless
five-year-old again.

322
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,159
I would snap you up.

323
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:15,695
Oh.

324
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:17,697
Next stop, pies.

325
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,165
Next stop, pies!

326
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:22,702
Next stop, pies,
next stop, pies!

327
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:24,570
Let's go, driver!

328
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:27,940
Laverne packs up the pie wagon
at 5:00, so--

329
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,510
At 5:00?
That's only 20 minutes from now.

330
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,680
The pie shop is 13 miles away.

331
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,915
So at 55 miles an hour,

332
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,418
that just gives us
5 minutes to spare.

333
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,453
So, wait,
when pies are involved,

334
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:43,756
you can suddenly do math
in your head?

335
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:47,760
Hold on, Kevin,
how much is 19,154 pies

336
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:50,296
divided by 61 pies?

337
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:54,067
314 pies.

338
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:56,102
What if it were salads?

339
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:59,338
Well, it's the--

340
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,243
carry the four and the--
it doesn't work.

341
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:06,713
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's
fantastic voyage, everyone,

342
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,081
but we're almost out of gas.

343
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,083
Okay, well, I saw a station
about a mile back,

344
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:11,417
so chop, chop.

345
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:13,853
That name brand place?
No, forget about it, sorry.

346
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:17,056
The tanks are so big on
this thing, 5¢ a gallon extra?

347
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,057
It really adds up.

348
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,425
Are you kidding me?

349
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:21,094
- Dwight, come on.
- Hey.

350
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,361
Honey, I don't think
we should push him.

351
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,563
Oh, no, I'm going to push him.

352
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,598
You know why?
Because you are getting a pie.

353
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,166
Why?
'Cause you deserve it.

354
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:28,501
And what is he doing?

355
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:29,902
He's trying to drive us all
around the countryside,

356
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:32,105
looking for gas because he
knows we won't get there.

357
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:33,206
Is that what we want?

358
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,507
No!

359
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,242
Stop ordering me around, Jim!

360
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:38,144
- What do we want?
- Pies!

361
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:39,145
When do we want it?

362
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:42,381
- Pies.
- Okay, fine.

363
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,719
You win, Jim.
You win.

364
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:47,720
We have been battling
for a long time,

365
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:49,255
but, you know what, you win.

366
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:50,890
'Cause you are the winner,
you are the alpha male.

367
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:52,058
There you go.

368
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,559
Alpha male,
go buy your wife a pie.

369
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,061
Go buy the whole world a pie.

370
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:58,197
That's impossible.

371
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,499
- Oh, no!
- Dwight!

372
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,566
- What are you doing?
- Dwight!

373
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:01,934
- What the hell?
- Whoa, Dwight.

374
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:05,037
- Dwight.
- What?

375
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,674
Well, now I don't even
feel like pie.

376
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:10,676
Wait.

377
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:11,978
No, it's back.

378
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,517
Just drive away.

379
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:19,187
Phyllis, that's not safe.

380
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:21,489
Guys, we only have
18 minutes left.

381
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:24,659
At 61 miles an hour, we're just
going to barely make it.

382
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:26,628
Go up and check on him,
he's upset.

383
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,196
You know
he's doing all this on purpose.

384
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:29,864
Please, just make sure
he's okay.

385
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,134
Hurry it up, for God's sake.

386
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:34,769
They're going to be
out of banana cream.

387
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:36,037
Banana cream's the first to go.

388
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,205
We'd be lucky to get pumpkin
at this point.

389
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,541
What?

390
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,043
Dwight?

391
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:43,878
Why are you such a jerk?

392
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,748
I'm trying to do something
for my wife, and you keep--

393
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,883
- I'm barren, Jim.

394
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:50,018
What?

395
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,254
My trouser hives
are void of honey.

396
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:55,590
I had congress with Angela,
and the child that she bore

397
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:57,559
did not issue from my loins.

398
00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:00,862
Thought I would be a father,
and instead I am a eunuch,

399
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:04,599
neutered by my own building.

400
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:07,636
Is this about the popcorn,
or the X on the ceiling?

401
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:10,705
Dwight, that was a prank.

402
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:12,340
You mean
you flooded my building

403
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:14,976
with dangerous electromagnetic
radiation as a prank?

404
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:16,478
- No.
- That's genius.

405
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,812
That's the best prank
you've ever done.

406
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:19,414
I'll take it.

407
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:23,685
Andy?

408
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,787
Who is it?

409
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:27,889
- Um, is this a good time?
- Yeah.

410
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:31,226
Perfect time, right in
the middle of a rooftop crisis.

411
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:33,728
Fine, yeah, let me read it.
What do we have here?

412
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,202
Okay--

413
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:40,101
You've made this very easy
for me.

414
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:41,503
It's unsignable.

415
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:44,539
Oh.
What, is there something--?

416
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:48,743
It's inaccurate, dishonest,
and, in a word, dong-water.

417
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:51,046
Oh, well, perhaps
I could reword some of it--

418
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:52,047
Here's the thing.

419
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,581
You asked me to do you a favor,

420
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,550
I did it, I read it.

421
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:59,054
Thank you very much to me
for my time.

422
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:00,755
Good luck
with your impossible dream.

423
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:04,292
All right, then.

424
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,870
Dwight, sometimes
it takes couples

425
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:17,172
years to get pregnant.

426
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:20,008
Really? How long did it take
you and Pam to conceive?

427
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,009
That doesn't matter.

428
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:22,544
What position
did you use to conceive,

429
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:24,079
regular
or lady-on-her-back?

430
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:26,147
You used lady-on-her-back,
didn't you, freak?

431
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:27,949
Yuck, gross.
Never mind, Jim.

432
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:41,296
British women,
famously over-emotional,

433
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:43,698
am I right?

434
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,500
I don't think that's Nellie.

435
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:48,136
- What?
- Oh.

436
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:50,605
Oh, no, no, no.
It's all right.

437
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:53,174
Really, it isn't your fault.

438
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:57,145
No, no. It's--
You were so kind,

439
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:58,880
and it isn't anything
to do with you.

440
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:03,151
Did you ever think that
because you own the building,

441
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:05,186
everyone in it,

442
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:06,621
we're all kind of like
your children.

443
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:09,691
You know, there's a phrase
about that in German,

444
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:10,892
<i>bilden-kinder,</i>

445
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:13,495
used almost exclusively
by childless landlords

446
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:16,197
to console themselves, but now,

447
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,666
I really understand it.

448
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:23,171
Well, now you have a bus full
of real building-kinder.

449
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:24,739
- <i>Bilden-kinder.</i>
<i>- </i> Okay.

450
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:29,277
And they're all dangerously
close to not getting pie.

451
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,713
And there's only one guy
who can save them.

452
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:33,214
It's not me.

453
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:34,749
- I agree.
- Oh!

454
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,651
Oh.

455
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,086
Hey, how did it go?

456
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:39,187
- It was pretty good, actually.
- Yeah?

457
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:40,755
We bonded,
we got to t--

458
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:41,756
- Oh!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

459
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:43,324
- Dwight, Dwight!
- Dwight!

460
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:45,360
That's what happens when
you don't get out of the way.

461
00:18:45,362 --> 00:18:48,029
Out of the way!

462
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:49,564
You feel okay now?

463
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,665
Oh, better than okay.

464
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,066
And you know what, honey?

465
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:54,135
I'm going to get you
that rhubarb pie.

466
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:55,537
Well, actually, rhubarb

467
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:56,704
- is the one pie that I don't--
- Don't, don't.

468
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:58,072
Everybody, hang on!

469
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:12,687
Pie, pie, pie, pie, pie, pie!

470
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:26,634
Oh.

471
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,269
I changed my mind.

472
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:30,705
- Oh, you signed it?
- Yeah.

473
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:33,741
Not as is, obviously.

474
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:34,776
Made a couple of changes,

475
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:37,912
added some sentences
at the end.

476
00:19:37,914 --> 00:19:40,715
Trust me, it needed it.

477
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:44,586
But, yeah, whatever.

478
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,626
"She's tough in business,
but tender

479
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:53,127
with the people
she cares about.

480
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:55,597
She'll make a wonderful mother
to any child

481
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,999
who can overlook
weird accents."

482
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:06,441
- I insult you, Oscar.
- What?

483
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:09,611
I insult you to your face.

484
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:11,646
I don't know
what you're talking about.

485
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:14,549
Then why don't you
do something about it?

486
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:16,851
Kevin, are you trying
to get me to hit you

487
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:17,952
in the face with my pie?

488
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:20,388
You don't have the guts.

489
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,426
You stupid, dumb,
doo-doo face.

490
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:34,302
Yes!

491
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:37,539
Oh, my God.
I'm getting so stuffed.

492
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:43,645
We did it.

493
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,813
You did it.
