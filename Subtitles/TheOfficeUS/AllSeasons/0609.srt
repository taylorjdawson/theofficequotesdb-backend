1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,140
Good morning everybody!

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,010
Who'd like an authentic NY bagel?

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,100
- Stanley?
- Thank you.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,010
Oh, no, no, no.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,750
I got a pumpernickel just for you.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,150
H and h.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,280
You went all the way to New
York City to get us bagels?

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,990
Oh, why, is there a place
closer that sells them?

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,160
This was really nice, Dwight.

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,710
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

11
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,070
Oh, don't mention it.

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,540
You owe me one.

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,000
You all owe me one.

14
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,040
- Good morning, Michael.
- Good morning, Dwight.

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,900
Hungry?

16
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,200
No. I had a fish stick sandwich.

17
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,930
Actually, I had two
fish stick sandwiches.

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,610
My girlfriend didn't want hers,

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,370
because I guess I'm the
only aphrodisiac she needs.

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,030
Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.

21
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,130
You're thinking of deer penis.

22
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,000
It worked.

23
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,330
Regardless, that was over two hours ago,

24
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,470
and it is now a scientific
fact that you are hungry--bagel?

25
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,200
I don't mind if I do.

26
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,700
Okay, I brought cheese too.

27
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,490
I'm taking one for my lady friend.

28
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,210
- Excellent.
- Brain food.

29
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,970
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

30
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,510
You owe me.

31
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,070
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for
his friends so they'll owe him a favor,

32
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,330
which he can use to get someone fired who
stole a co-manager position from him anymore?

33
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,600
Jeez... When did
everyone get so cynical?

37
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,060
Pam, would you care for a bagel?

38
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,200
Oh, no, thank you.

39
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,380
Oh, that's right, you're a woman, and
you need to refuse food the first time.

40
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,960
I'll try again.

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,750
Please, Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.

42
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,560
I have an early lunch.

43
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,730
Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to
hang out ever since he started dating my mom.

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,670
I don't know, I really hoped
this thing would just die out.

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,470
But today he's planning a birthday
lunch for my mom, and we have to go.

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,560
No way out.

47
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,910
No way out.

48
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,610
These are amazing.

49
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,700
You took all these?

50
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,740
I've always found beauty
in uncommon places.

51
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,970
Homeless people.

52
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,370
Graffiti photography
lets me capture all that.

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,320
Have you ever been photographed before?

54
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,550
Just by, like, friends.

55
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,050
Well, here's what I've
been doing around here.

56
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,480
It's for a series on
exposure in the workplace.

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Pammy?

58
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,900
- Hey...
- hi.

59
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,900
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

60
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,490
Girls...there they are.

61
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,910
Birthday
lunch. Birthday lunch--

62
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,870
there's no better medicine
than birthday lunch.

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,320
It'll cure all of your, "Gee, I don't know
if Michael should be dating my mother, "

64
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,820
and fixes all occurrences of," I
don't really see them together.

65
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,650
'so open wide, Pam, and take a big ol'
spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.

66
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,720
Take with food.

67
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,930
Pam, aren't you gonna introduce
us to Michael's girlfriend?

68
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,100
I think you guys all remember
my mom from the wedding.

69
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,250
Yeah, I think everyone's
met Helene. Shall we?

70
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,720
Wait a minute, is that another
birthday present for me?

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,850
'Cause you already gave me a necklace.

72
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,270
Oh, my god, I love it.

73
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,140
- Tell her how you gave it to me.
- No, that wouldn't be...

74
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,220
he put it around my neck while
I was still asleep this morning.

75
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,490
What a nice way to wake up.

76
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,990
Yeah, the rest of the story has been
censored due to inappropriosity.

77
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,600
- Because of sex?
- Kevin!

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,490
Hey, please, Kevin... You're fired.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,110
Sorry.

80
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,050
Work with a bunch of idiots.

81
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,970
- Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go.

82
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,990
Oh, wait.

83
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,380
Swartz lumber is on the phone for
you, Pam, and they say it's urgent.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,710
You guys, just one second.

85
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,310
Oh, my gosh!

86
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,590
Are you serious?

87
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,340
Shipping emergency.

88
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,620
I don't think I can go to lunch.

89
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,360
Oh, man, that's crazy.

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,900
We were on our way out too.

91
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,910
I know. Isn't that always how it goes?

92
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,260
Rarely, if ever.

93
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,570
Let me give it a whirl.

94
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,990
- I want to handle it.
- That's okay.

95
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,790
- I feel like.
- It's my pleasure.

96
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,770
Hello? Well, that's great.

97
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,910
Turns out the paper was there all along.

98
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,830
Oh, thank god.

99
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,990
Something's up.

100
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,290
That paper was never supposed to arrive.

101
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,670
So, Pammy, are you still liking sales?

102
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,930
Yeah. It's exciting.

103
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,470
Uh, you know, Michael and I were talking,

104
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,360
and maybe if you put in a little more
face-to-face time with your clients,

105
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,600
you could improve your sales.

106
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,280
Pam's sales are fine, actually.

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,200
Just want you to succeed, Pammy.

108
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,140
You know what? We shouldn't even
be talking about business today.

109
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,120
Thank you.

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,610
Today's about family.

111
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,760
Why did I get in the car?

112
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,470
I could have struggled.

113
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,240
I have a whistle in my
purse. I didn't even blow it.

114
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,250
Oh, Dwight, I have a
little surprise for you.

115
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,240
Let me guess, you ate the
bagel I gave you and loved it.

116
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,670
Yes.

117
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,290
And I wanted to return the favor.

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
I was polishing my loafers,

119
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,770
and I happened to look over and notice that
your briefcase was a little worse for the wear.

120
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,030
So a little elbow grease, and she's
polished right up, back to her former glory.

121
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,350
- Oh, well...
- Feel it against your cheek.

122
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,490
I will.

123
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,540
You give me a
gift- Thank you note.

124
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,330
You invite me
somewhere--RSVP.

125
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,450
You do me a
favor--Favor returned.

126
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,810
Do not test my politeness.

127
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,250
Let me get that door for you.

128
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,260
- There we go.
- Thank you very much.

129
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,170
- And I got it for you.
- Oh, goodness. Thanks

130
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,680
Hey, you know, here's
a healthy fitness tip.

131
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,410
If you clench your buttocks
together while walking,

132
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,180
you can really take the
pressure off your knees.

133
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,790
- Is that right?
- Observe.

134
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,500
- Right?
- That really works.

135
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,100
Yeah, feel free to use that anytime.

136
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,410
- Okay...
- hold on a second.

137
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,900
Do not walk around with
your jacket cattywampus.

138
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,850
And that needs to be
straight as an arrow.

139
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,180
Thank you very much.

140
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,550
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.

141
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,300
Thank you very much for that.

142
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,690
- Have a seat. Please.
- Have a seat yourself.

143
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,790
You know what, I am going to preemptively
change the batteries in your wireless mouse.

144
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,020
- Not necessary.
- No, no, no.

145
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,910
You don't have to do that.

146
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,130
Andy is complicating things.

147
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,430
But I'm not worried.

148
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,340
This will only up my game.

149
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,680
Hello. "Scott," table for four.

150
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,600
Welcome, Scott family.

151
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,210
It'll be just a moment.

152
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,860
I used to love coming here.

153
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,300
The chicken parm is good.

154
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,820
Big part of my childhood.

155
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,720
Oh, maybe Michael will
start dating that too.

156
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,500
What table should we take?

157
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,200
So many to choose from.

158
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,440
- Oh, my god!
- What?

159
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,230
All I see are boring old tables
with no birthday decorations.

160
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,530
Oh, wait a second!

161
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,900
You mean this one?

162
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,990
Michael, you did all this?

163
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,280
It's not about taking credit. Let's
just say we all did it.

164
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,550
Well, thank you. All of you.

165
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,270
Well, it was actually me alone, so....

166
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,100
Wow, look at this place.

167
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,010
It really makes me want
to go to Italy someday.

168
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,440
Oh, you'll love it.

169
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,970
You can have my guide books.

170
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,050
I think I'm done with those
really long plane rides.

171
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,490
Oh, thank you for-- thanks
for lending me the book.

172
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,790
So, mom, which birthday are
we celebrating this year?

173
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,370
Oh, sticking with 49.

174
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,670
49 again?

175
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,990
That's nine years in a row.

176
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,900
This is now our longest
family tradition.

177
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,420
That's funny.

178
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,640
Well, as long as you're running
numbers, Pam, help me out with this one.

179
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,340
Let's see, honey, you're
six months pregnant,

180
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,400
but you've only been
married for 30 days.

181
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,020
So what does that add up to?

182
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,860
Ooh, burn. Burn on you.

183
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,450
And a little bit on me too.

184
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,960
You're 54 years old.

185
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,000
No, I'm 58.

186
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,120
You're 58 years old?

187
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,160
Congratulations.

188
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,400
The only time you should care about a
woman's age is if she is too young for you.

189
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,490
And I am not robbing the cradle.

190
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,340
If anything, I am robbing the grave.

191
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,930
Mom, have you decided what
you want to be called?

192
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,810
I like "Nana."

193
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,060
but I also like the classic "grandma."

194
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,720
- Please be grandma. I want you to be grandma.
- Definitely a grandma.

195
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,280
Michael, what do you think? Grandma?

196
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,360
Grandma.

197
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,860
Hey, would you guys ever
do a triathlon, you think?

198
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,280
Maybe.

199
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,500
Helene?

200
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,260
Oh, oh, no.

201
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,200
I don't think so.

202
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,190
I am.

203
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,390
I'm definitely gonna do it.

204
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,530
I've already got the run
and the bike thing down.

205
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,360
I just need to learn how to swim.

206
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,790
Come on, you in?

207
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,610
No, no, I think a triathlon is pretty
much something I can rule out.

208
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,560
It just doesn't interest me.

209
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,950
So it's a matter of interest.

210
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,180
Good. Okay.

211
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,390
It's not anything you
would have ever done.

212
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,130
Mm, I might have done
it when I was younger,

213
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,600
but now there are just other things that
I'd rather be doing than running and jumping.

214
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,640
Well, there's no jumping in a triathlon.

215
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,780
You're thinking the broad jump.

216
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,260
Would you try...

217
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,890
- Bungee jumping?
- No.

218
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,050
- Snowboarding?
- No, no.

219
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,140
You want to go snowboarding?

220
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,750
I might.

221
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,340
Michael, what are you talking about?

222
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,600
Nothing.

223
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,400
Just life and... Doing
things... Before you die.

224
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,670
I don't know.

225
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,370
Do I really want to go snowboarding?

226
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,880
No.

227
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,650
But I-- I would like
to if I wanted to.

228
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,090
What's going on in here?

229
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,240
Andy bought lunch.

230
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,890
Oh, no, really?

231
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,610
Took a page right out of the
old Schrute book of niceness.

232
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,810
There is no book. There's
only a survival guide.

233
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,590
You bought breakfast for
everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.

234
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,760
Okay, well, allow me.

235
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,650
You know
what--

236
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,390
gosh, these tacos are
awfully complicated to make.

237
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,620
I will make everyone's tacos.

238
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,190
So we should get the check?

239
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,040
- What about your gift, Michael?
- Oh, no, no, no.

240
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,810
No, it's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it.

241
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,360
- I'm sure I won't.
- Yes, you will.

242
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,250
He locked himself in his office
all morning working on it.

243
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,230
Oh, gimme! Look at this wrapping paper.

244
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,760
It's got the word "love"
on it in every language!

245
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,670
I literally--I put no thought
into the wrapping at all.

246
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,130
Might as well have been toilet paper.

247
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,760
Toilet paper...

248
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,510
"a scrapbook of our first
memories," by Michael Gary Scott.

249
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,230
For my girlfriend
Helene on your birthday."

250
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,730
That's just an arbitrary title.

251
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,140
Okay, here's a penny.

252
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,620
- What's that from?
- Penny for your thoughts.

253
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,270
It was from the wishing
well at the mall.

254
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,420
You threw it in, and I went back
later, waded in, and I found it.

255
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,750
That's amazing!

256
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,610
It's not amazing at all.

257
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,150
It's sort of weird that
I went and did that.

258
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,920
And now your wish won't
come true, so that blows.

259
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,100
- A poem.
- Oh, that I plagiarized, I think.

260
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,420
"I cannot go to school today
said little Peggy Ann McKay,"

261
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,360
- is that Shel Silverstein?
- Yeah.

262
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,980
"I have the measles and the mumps, a
gash, a rash, and purple bumps,

263
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,160
and my teacher's really mean--
happy birthday, I love you, Helene."

264
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,880
that's really nice, Michael.

265
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,770
Well, I think it sucks.

266
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,420
I think it's
wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.

267
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,590
Well, that's because you and
I have very different taste.

268
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,130
And you like lame things.

269
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,150
It's a generational
sort of gap between us.

270
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,260
God, a scrapbook.

271
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,520
Home run, Michael.

272
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,500
- You set the bar so high.
- That was a bunt.

273
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,910
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dwight, I'm gonna do this.

274
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,280
Hey, hey, hey, relax.

275
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,410
I got it covered.

276
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,650
- No, no, no.
- No, I insist.

277
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,140
Okay, Dwight, this is ridiculous.

278
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,380
Don't worry about
it. You can just owe me.

279
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,210
Hey, where'd you go?

280
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,700
Oh, just went to the bathroom.

281
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,140
And then you stopped at
the bar on the way back?

282
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,710
Got thirsty.

283
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,030
Okay, weirdo.

284
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,420
Come on, it's time for cake.

285
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,650
Oh, okay.

286
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,690
Honestly, for a long time I thought
I was going to grow old with holly.

287
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,960
And then I met Helene, and she is great.

288
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,850
And she already knows and has done
everything that I have ever wanted to do,

289
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,230
and can tell me about it.

290
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,410
But I think I want to
do those things myself.

291
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,510
The cake's really good.

292
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,570
Oh, I know.

293
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,390
I love it when they use
butter-cream frosting.

294
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,440
Finish your cake, Helene.

295
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,890
I want you to enjoy that cake because I
have something terrible I need to tell you,

296
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:20,120
and I want you to enjoy your cake before
I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.

297
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,360
Al Helene, I think you're
a wonderful person,

298
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,440
and I--god, I've enjoyed dating you
and being your boyfriend so much.

299
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,270
But I've to consider Pam's feelings.

300
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,290
As a friend and a -worker,

301
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,470
I cannot in good conscience continue to
date you when I know what this is doing to her.

302
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,000
Michael--
Michael, it's- it's okay.

303
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,250
No, it's not.

304
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,590
I know that it took me a
little while to come around,

305
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,590
and it's still a little weird to get used
to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.

306
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,630
And that makes me happy.

307
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,380
Wow, that just--
you've really grown.

308
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,050
Well...

309
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,700
Oh, thank you, Pam.

310
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,600
And I hope you're as gracious
during this next part.

311
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,390
Helene, once again, you are a wonderful
person, and you have lived a great life.

312
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,400
And I envy it.

313
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,940
And I want it, someday.

314
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,850
But just in the future.

315
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,600
You need somebody who-- o
understands your references.

316
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,940
Who is Kafkaesque?

317
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,250
I've never--I
don't know him.

318
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,120
There's another woman, and
her name is Italy...

319
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,850
and skydiving... and bungee jumping.

320
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,090
Okay, so...

321
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,480
And I want kids.

322
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,770
And you, unfortunately, have already completed
that part of your journey down there.

323
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,240
- Michael!
- It's not my decision. It's mother nature.

324
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,730
And mother has very strict rules about...

325
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,850
fertility.

326
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,720
Yeah, I, um... I got it.

327
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,690
I'm 58.

328
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,610
What am I supposed to do now?

329
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,040
- Well, hobbies...
- Stop.

330
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,690
- What's going on?
- Stupid thing wedged up there.

331
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,220
No one in this office will help me.

332
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,480
Move it.

333
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,970
What if Dwight dies and
I still owe him something?

334
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,170
That is a recipe for a ghost.

335
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,500
- Oh, yeah, you're gonna owe me big time.
- It's like a little envelope...there you go.

336
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,000
Got it. "To Dwight"?

337
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,690
A Starbucks gift card.

338
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,600
Surprise!

339
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,710
It's for everybody.

340
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,170
$15 value.

341
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,190
Damn it! I am no closer to taking Jim down.

342
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,030
Ugh, what a waste of the day.

343
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,690
I could have grown poison mushrooms
that'd be this high by now!

344
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,810
They're mushrooms.

345
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,490
They don't get that high.

346
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,550
Pamela Beasley Halpert.

347
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,770
- What?
- May I have a word with you in my office, please?

348
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,590
I am working.

349
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,870
Well... This is a work-related matter.

350
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,610
- Really?
- Yes.

351
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,590
- Really?
- Yes.

352
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,630
Join me, please, won't you?

353
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,360
- I'm going to give you a raise, Pam.
- Why?

354
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,600
Because of all the good work you've done.

355
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,600
I have the lowest
sales record of anyone here.

356
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,060
No, no.

357
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,260
It's not about numbers, Pam.

358
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,370
It's about attitude.

359
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,070
I have the worst
attitude of any person here.

360
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,860
Do you want the raise or what?

361
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,290
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- Okay.

362
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,060
Hey, Pam.

363
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,270
With this raise there
are strings attached.

364
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,650
And the string is attached from
my heart to your mean attitude.

365
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,710
You're bribing me.

366
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,340
No, no. No, am not.

367
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,280
Unless you want me to. You want me to?

368
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,620
'Cause I will. I will bribe you.

369
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,550
No...your face is saying don't.

370
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,090
Unless I haven't offered you enough.

371
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,820
Your face isn't changing.

372
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,080
What is it?

373
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Talk to me, face. Tell me
what Pam's brain is thinking.

374
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,880
Oh, come on, what do you
want? What do you want?

375
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,240
Do you want a million dollars?

376
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,540
Do you want to hit me?

377
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,180
You want me to get down
on one knee and beg you?

378
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,310
- I want to hit you.
- What?

379
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,240
I want to hit you. I'll do that.

380
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,780
Okay. What?

381
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,300
I don't-- are
you kidding?

382
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,480
No. Are you kidding?

383
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,780
Ye--no. I don't--
all right, come on.

384
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,660
I'll take off my jacket and
tense my stomach, and you just...

385
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,190
No, I don't think I can
hit you in the office.

386
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,630
Ok.

387
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,190
So we'll do it after work?

388
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,710
In the parking lot.

389
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,620
In front of everyone.

390
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,210
I'm gonna hit you as hard as I can.

391
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,030
Okay.

392
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

393
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,760
- See you then.
- See you.

394
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,880
Quick question.

395
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,140
Are you scared?

396
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,790
Never.

397
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,960
About what?

398
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,040
A little. What are you talking about?

399
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,330
Heard about the punch.

400
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,310
- What punch?
- Pam.

401
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,960
She's gonna punch the crap
out of your face after work.

402
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,020
I'm pretty sure we said "slap."

403
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,990
No, it's a punch.

404
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,010
And Pam has that crazy
pregnancy strength now.

405
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,580
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem
to understand what's going to happen.

406
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,220
Do you?

407
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,680
Uh. I'm good.

408
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,240
All right, see you there.

409
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,140
- Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
- Inappropriate.

410
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,280
I mean, do you ever
wrestle with each other?

411
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,720
- All the time.
- Really?

412
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,710
- Is she strong?
- She wants it bad, Michael.

413
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,960
Can you stop this?

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,810
- I can.
- Okay.

415
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,040
- And I don't support her choice to hit you.
- I don't either.

416
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,380
But at the same time, she goes crazy.

417
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,240
And I do understand her reasoning.

418
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,200
I know.

419
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,280
I just need some time.

420
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,650
- Give me some time to think about it.
- You gotta do something.

421
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,170
- Give me some time to make a decision.
- How much time do you need?

422
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,060
- No me than a week. Maybe two.
- Come on, man!

423
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,890
Pam, can I talk to you for a second?

424
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,880
I heard about the hit.

425
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,870
Just to be sure, it's off
company property, right?

426
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,900
- Right.
- Okay

427
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,790
I think it should probably be okay.

428
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,380
- Okay.
- Okay.

429
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:04,420
And... The--the power
comes from the back foot.

430
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,180
So it's all one motion through the body.

431
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,890
So there's-- you
stay a little low.

432
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,580
There's a twist.

433
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,130
You keep your shoulder down.

434
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,230
You kind of throw out the arm.

435
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,520
Okay, wait.

436
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,680
It's-- you're saying
it comes from the foot?

437
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,910
Yes.

438
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,280
Okay.

439
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,910
Yeah. Okay.

440
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,970
Hey, everybody, he's not in the men's room,

441
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,790
although the seat was warm, so
we may have just missed him.

442
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,070
My money's on Pam.

443
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,840
It's not a fight what other
outcome could there be?

444
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,080
Michael could win.

445
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,050
How?

446
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,970
He can't hit back.

447
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,830
Why can't you just
agree with me sometimes?

448
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,240
Am I scared of getting
hit in the face? No.

449
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,180
Every day, weirdos pay dominatrices
hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.

450
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,230
I'm scared I'm gonna love it.

451
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,720
Let's do this!

452
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,750
It's okay, guys, I can handle this.

453
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,100
Everybody can go home.

454
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,120
We're here for the show, Michael.

455
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,270
You're just a bunch of voyeurs.

456
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,510
Are you eating popcorn?

457
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,810
Has almost no calories.

458
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,090
You ready?

459
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,160
Yes.

460
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,560
- You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
- I know.

461
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Okay. All right.

462
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,580
No! God!

463
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,160
Michael! You have to keep your hands down.

464
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,730
Put your hands in your pockets.

465
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,310
Okay.

466
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,860
Pam! Pam...

467
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,390
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

468
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,560
What are you sorry for?

469
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,030
So many things. I don't
know, it's hard to choose.

470
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,830
How' bout for dating my mom.

471
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,760
- Maybe that's...
- And dumping her on her birthday.

472
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,260
Yes.

473
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:52,030
Okay, just... Don't ever date
a member of my family again.

474
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,340
Okay. No problem.

475
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,320
For the record, your mom came on to me.

476
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,340
Holy crap!

477
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,330
- Are you okay?
- No!

478
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,200
You're okay.

479
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,550
Feel better?

480
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,370
No. You were right.

481
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,100
Com wait, why are you limping?

482
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,410
I don't know.

483
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,280
Let's get some raw meat on that face.

484
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,320
I've got a chicken in
the freezer upstairs.

485
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,850
As I watched Pam's big, strong
hand coming toward my face,

486
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,090
I saw my entire life
flash before my eyes.

487
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,510
And guess what.

488
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,240
I have four kids.

489
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,540
And I have a hover-car
and a hover-house.

490
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,160
And my wife is a runner, and it shows.

491
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,290
And Pam and Jim are my best
friends, and our kids play together.

492
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:51,730
And I am happy, I'm rich, and I never die.

493
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,490
It doesn't sound like
much, but it's enough for me.

494
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,530
Good, good. Just keep it on
there for another five minutes.

495
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,380
Let the swelling go down.

496
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,190
Oh, thank you.

497
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,640
Thanks. I owe you one, Dwight.

498
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,930
Fire Jim.

499
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,210
No.

500
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,250
I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him!

501
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,340
- What are you talk...
- do it!

502
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,260
Promote me.

503
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,150
- Tri-managers?
- Forget that.

504
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,390
- Can I have an office?
- No.

505
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,530
You know what? You can keep your
stupid favor. It's worthless.

506
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,190
And this is my dinner on
your face. I'm keeping it!

507
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,490
Oh, that feels better.
