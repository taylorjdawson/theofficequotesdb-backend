MICHAEL: I am
on a lecture circuit.

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,200
I'm going around
to all the branches,

3
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,173
and I am telling them
my secret recipe
for success.

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,039
I have now memorized
all of your names.

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:17,476
Shirty, mole,
lazy eye,
Mexico, baldy.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,580
Hi, Kelly.
Screw you.

7
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:20,710
Excuse me.

8
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:21,981
Screw you, too.

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,587
You forgot her birthday.

10
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,123
...and I turn
it on and I say,

11
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,456
"Prepare yourself
for the Utica Chain
Store Massacre."

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,523
How's Jim?
We're engaged.

13
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,791
Oh, my God.
I'm so happy for you.

14
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,355
Wow. Thank you.

You remember Holly?

18
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,702
She used to work for HR.

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,244
She was the love of my life.

20
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,312
She just left and
I never got closure.

21
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,875
And I feel like
I need to go to Nashua
and get closure.

22
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,749
Okay. Let's go.

23
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,638

24
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:23,977
I didn't eat lunch.

25
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,043
I didn't eat
all my lunch.

26
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,780

27
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,555

Nice, Kevin.
Looks good.

28
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,287
It... Yeah.

29
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,490
Angela, you're more
chipper than usual.

30
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,971
I am proud to announce
that there is a new addition
to the Martin family.

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,976
She's hypo-allergenic,
she doesn't struggle
when you try to dress her,

32
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,807
she's a third-generation
show cat.

33
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,074
Her father was in
Meet the Parents.

34
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,480
Needless to say,
she's very, very
expensive.

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,074
How much?
$7,000.

36
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,916
For a cat?
I can get you
a kid for that.

37
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,516
Where did you get
that kind of money?

38
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,922
I sold Andy's
engagement ring
on eBay.

39
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,926
Wait, you didn't
give it back?

40
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,053
He wouldn't
have wanted that.

41
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,255
Her name is Princess Lady.

42
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,824
Seven grand.
I've got to see
that little bitch.

43
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,063
I have something
better than a picture.
Come on.

44
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,698
OSCAR: You have your
cats on Nanny Cam.

45
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,004
Yeah. I mean,
I usually try to take leave
when I get a new cat,

46
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,669
but I'm out of
vacation days,

47
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,339
and this
company still doesn't
recognize cat maternity.

48
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,678
I mean, somebody has a kid,
oh, sure, take off a year.

49
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,945
She's right.
I had my second kid
just for the vacation.

50
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,385
Right. Anyways,
I just want to make sure

51
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,582
Princess Lady is
acclimating well.

52
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,652
She means more
to me than anyone.

53
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,453
Any cat, you mean.

54
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,393
And person.

55
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,364
So, detour.
We're now adding Nashua
to the lecture circuit,

56
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,703
so Michael can confront Holly
and get some closure.

57
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,070
Nashua actually
sounded very excited
on the phone.

58
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,942
I don't think they get
a lot of visitors.

59
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,108
Because their
office is only accessible
by cross-country skis.

learn in there?

learned things, huh?

hell's going on?

Why don't you tell Jim
where you were
from ages 14 to 15?

Hey, Dwight,
sounds like she was 14,

77
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,444
so maybe we want
to go a little easy.

78
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,747
If she's old enough
to get married,

79
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,651
she's old enough
to follow the law.

80
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,314
What did you do?

81
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,960
My boyfriend dumped me,
so I stole his boat.

82
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,921
He told me it was his boat.
It was actually his father's.

83
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,124
I just thought it'd
be really romantic,

84
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,565
like Thelma & Louise,
but with, like, a boat.

85
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,069
And it was the worst
year of my life.

that you guys are

yesterday was your birthday.

Well, there's no
flowers or toys or...

there's nothing on it.

find a cake like this?

have my name on it.

what the theme is!
What's the theme?

It's birthday.
Frosting.

get in touch with

a Chiclet on my cake?

343
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:42,344
That's the best part.
That represents a pillow.
Or a television.

344
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,718
Our theme, if you will.

345
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,313
Because the fun part
is you get to decide

346
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,449
on an hour of television
or an hour of napping.

347
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,187
That's our theme.

348
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,928
Cool.
Yeah?

349
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,489
I love it.

350
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,124
Oh, yes! Okay, good.

351
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,464
So what's it
going to be, Kapoor?

352
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,402
Can she pick
a half hour of each?

353
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,530
No.
No.

354
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,268
Then pick TV.

355
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,037
MEREDITH: Pick a nap.
OSCAR: No, no. TV.

356
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,738
Watching TV at
work is really cool.

357
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,872
Pick a nap.
Nothing good
is on right now.

358
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,176
Bonnie Hunt is on.

359
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,184
You know what?
I have been watching
TV all week.

360
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,617
I choose nap.
All right.

361
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,383
Okay, nap it is.
Everyone out! Get out.

362
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,357
We're going to be
eating cake at our desks.

363
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,392
Let's go. Move it.

364
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,727
Let's go, go, go,
go, go, come on.
I got this.

365
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:34,901
This is for you.
And happy birthday, Kell.

366
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,939
Thank you.

367
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,639
Okay. You've got one hour.

368
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,778
I'm too excited to sleep.

369
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,883
Mmm.

370
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,924
Great cake.

371
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,126
Thanks.

372
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,128
(DOOR OPENS)

373
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,575
(BANGING)

374
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,246
Birthday time is over.

375
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,714
Now go make up for
all the work you missed

376
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,478
when you were
taking your nap.

377
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,186
Many happy returns.

378
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,796
I feel great.
So good to have closure.

379
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,090
(EXCLAIMS)

380
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,499
We should go apologize
to Roy or something.

381
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,127
No. We don't
need to do that.

382
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,401
Who have I wronged?
Who have I wronged?

383
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,702
Oh! Oh!

384
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,039
What about that fat guy
from Stamford
that I insulted?

385
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,602
We should find him.
You mean Tony.

386
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,115
Jabba the Hutt,
Pizza the Hut.

387
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,346
Fat guys like pizza,
pepperoni pizza,
Pepperoni Tony.

388
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,579
Oh, Michael.

389
00:20:56,121 --> 00:21:00,990
Man, was he fat.
So, so fat.

390
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,793
You know what?
Forget it.

391
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:08,094
I know me. When I saw him
I would never be able
to apologize to him.

392
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,305
Too fat. Big, fat fatty.
