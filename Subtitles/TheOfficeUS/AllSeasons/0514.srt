Not maybe, yes or no.

173
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,999
No way. Uh-uh.

174
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,443
Are you from another planet?

175
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,639
Boy, have you
lost your mind?

176
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,942
Because I'll
help you find it!

177
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,039
Did I stutter?

178
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,845
I'm done. Goodbye.

179
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,345
But the doctor said
if I can't find a new way

180
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:47,188
to relate more positively
to my surroundings,
I'm going to die.

181
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,716

(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
A throne for your highness.

183
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,465
I'm not sitting
in a wheelchair.

184
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,625
No, no, no.
No debate.

185
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,031
You are going to
sit in that wheelchair

186
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,763
until you are
back on your feet.

187
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,302
I'm going to die.

188
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,870
ABC, okay?

189
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,140
And that stands for
"Airway, Breathing
and Circulation."

190
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,181
Okay. You know what?
That could be
a little confusing,

191
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,910
because in sales ABC
means "Always Be Closing."

192
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,077
This is a farce.
I should be
teaching this course.

193
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,177
Shut it. Shut it.

194
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:19,213
We found ourselves
on the less prepared
side of things

195
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,884
when Stanley had his...

196
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,552
When his heart went berserk.

197
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,553
And I knew
exactly what to do.

198
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,464
But in a much more real sense,
I had no idea what to do.

199
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,526
So I thought we should have
a CPR training class.

200
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,267
And of course you can't
get the practice dummy

201
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,707
unless the instructor
comes along with it.

202
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,075
Red Cross and their racket.

203
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,246
I can't keep
doing this forever.

204
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,909
It's been 20 seconds.

205
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,616
Call it.

206
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,986
Would you like to try next?

207
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,957
Absolutely I would not.

208
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,323
You know who
I really think
should go?

209
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,194
Stanley.

210
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,594
Oh, I don't know.

211
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,360
It's not
a good idea, Michael.
He needs to rest.

212
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,231
No rest for the sick.

213
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,007
We are not always
going to be there

214
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:14,103
to coddle
your heart back when it
disappears to be working.

215
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,774
What are you going to do
if you're by yourself
and your heart stops?

216
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,214
I would die.

217
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,615
And you're
okay with that?

218
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,448
I'm okay with
the logic of it.

219
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,580
Uh-uh. No, no, no.
Come on. Get up.
Let's do this.

220
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,454
STANLEY: Yes,
I had a heart attack.

221
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,426
I would quit,
but I'm too old
to find another job.

222
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,622
And I don't have
enough saved to retire.

223
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,495
I feel like I'm
working in my own casket.

224
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,030
Come on, Stanley!
You're losing you!

225
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,968
You're losing you! Do it!

226

MICHAEL: This is you
we're talking about.

227
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,029
Michael.

228
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,235
Okay, okay,
I'll show them.
Here we go.

229
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,677
All right.
ROSE:
So assessing the situation.

230
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,340
Are they breathing?

231
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,385
No, Rose.
They are not breathing.

232
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,182
And they have no arms or legs.

233
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,381
No, that's not part of it.

234
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,548
Where are they?

235
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,922
You know what?
If we come across somebody

236
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,986
with no arms or legs,
do we bother
resuscitating them?

237
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,396
I mean, what kind of
quality of life
do we have there?

238
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,195
I would want to
live with no legs.

239
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,929
How about no arms?

240
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,631
No arms or legs is
basically how you exist
right now, Kevin.

241
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,003
You don't do anything.

242
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,601
ROSE: All right.
Well, let's get back to it,
because you're losing him.

243
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,969
Okay, too fast.

244
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,879
Everyone, we need to
pump at a pace of 100
beats per minute.

245
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,406
Okay. That's hard
to keep track.
How many is that per hour?

246
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,577
How is that
going to help you?

247
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,019
I will divide
and then count to it.
Right.

248
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,454
Okay, well, a good trick

249
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,288
is to pump to
the tune of Staying Alive
by the Bee Gees.

250
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,349
Do you know that song?

251
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,760
Yes, yes. I do.
I love that song.

Yeah. Okay,
you didn't maintain
a hundred beats per minute.

271
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,304
And the ambulance
didn't arrive
because nobody called 911.

272
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,369
So you lost him.

273
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,178
Okay, he's dead.
Anyone know what we do next?

274
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,310
Anybody? Rose?

275
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,614
I have no idea.
Anyone else?

276
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,555
We bury him.
Wrong! Check for
an organ donor card.

277
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,615
If he has one,
we only have
minutes to harvest.

278
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,717
He has no wallet,
I checked.

Can you tell me
why you had to cut
the face off the dummy?

296
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,016
I didn't think it
was very realistic
in the movie,

297
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,562
and it turns out
it's pretty realistic.

298
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,622
We had to pay for it.
It cost us $3,500.

00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,896
$5,300 for a dummy?
Wow.

David, this is
why we have training.

and we learn
from our mistakes.

not to cut the face

were eating soup?

that was breakfast.

Does soup
symbolize breakfast?

with his daughter,

All right, Kevin,
enough with
the Michael jokes.

687
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,018
I think he got it
bad enough yesterday.

Attention, everyone,
I've just got
a text from Michael.

691
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,527
He says "personnel day."
Are we hiring?

692
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,256
Yeah. You're being replaced.

693
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,059
I think he meant
personal day.

694
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,394
I don't know.
That's quite a leap, Pam.

695
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,401
I hope he's okay.
I feel bad.

696
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,460
Give it up. He's dead.

697
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,868
He just sent a text.

698
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,963

You know, sometimes
to get perspective,

701
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,600
I like to think about
a spaceman on a star
incredibly far away,

702
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,830
and our problems don't
matter to him

703
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,636
because we're just
a distant point of light.

704
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,001
But he feels sorry for me

705
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,214
because he has
an incredibly
powerful microscope

706
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,182
and he can see my face.

707
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,886
I'm okay.

715
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:50,621
It's not that you
dumped my granddaughter,

716
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:54,590
and it's not that
you want children,
it's that you lied to me.

Okay. Yeah,
I'll see you then.

Was it my fault?

Yeah.

738
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,201
He said that you told him
how much you love me,

739
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,280
about how you feel
when I walk in a room

740

you've never doubted
for a second

that I'm the woman
you want to spend
the rest of your life with.

felt that with my mom,

I guess it also means

that sometimes
love affairs look different
to the people inside them.

to be a movie critic.
