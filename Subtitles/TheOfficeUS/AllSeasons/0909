1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,341
[Sighs]
I'm having second thoughts

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,426
about one
of the shirts I packed.

3
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:13,979
The blue one with the stripes.

4
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,181
I'm sure it's fine.
It's a blue shirt.

5
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:18,650
Well, yeah, but I'm wondering
if it's too blue.

6
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:23,855
Like, am I making
a statement with the blueness?

7
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:27,091
I am leaving early today
for Philly,

8
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,829
because tomorrow is
the first day of my new job.

9
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:33,315
So I figure
I'd get in at 5:00,

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,867
check into a hotel
at about 6:00

11
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,652
so I can get a real good night

12
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:40,522
of restless sleep
and nervous puking.

13
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:42,073
Uh, excuse me.
Trying to get work done.

14
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:44,209
Some people don't care
about Jim's new sports job

15
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:45,877
in Phila-whatever.

16
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,580
So you know my job
has something to do with sports,

17
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:51,282
but you don't know the end
of the word "Philadelphia"?

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,651
Philadelphia.

19
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,669
From the Greek <i>philia,</i>
<i>meaning "love,"</i>

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,638
and <i>adelph,</i>
<i>meaning "Adolf."</i>

21
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:57,973
"The city
that loves Adolf."

22
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:00,008
Good luck
with your new enterprise.

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,726
And don't wear
the blue striped shirt.

24
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,230
It makes your neck
look like an old mop handle.

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,850
Oh...
Hey, guys,

26
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,902
the Christmas party is today.

27
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,687
Merry Christmas, everyone!

28
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,239
- No.
- Is it?

29
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:15,490
- I mean,
it says "X-mas party,"

30
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:17,859
but I think we all know
what that's code for.

31
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,195
So we're not gonna have
a Christmas party this year?

32
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,163
Angela, how could you
do this to us?

33
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,082
Oh, right, like I'm responsible

34
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:26,117
'cause I'm in charge
of the party planning committee.

35
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:27,919
Well, you are
the one in charge of it.

36
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,154
Don't blame me
for something we all forgot.

37
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:32,874
Yeah, let's not blame her
for something we all forgot.

38
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:36,160
I didn't realize how many of
Angela's opinions I agreed with,

39
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:37,996
until she tried
to have my kneecap shattered

40
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,431
for sleeping with her husband.

41
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:42,784
She makes a lot
of very sound points.

42
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:44,019
I knew the party was today,

43
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:46,104
but nobody asked me to plan it,
so I didn't.

44
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:47,806
Hmm, funny how that works.

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,507
[Scoffs] We're out there

46
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:51,476
sweating our balls off
every day,

47
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,777
bustin' our balls.

48
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,446
We deserve a Christmas party!

49
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,347
Well, then, why don't we
just get some liquor

50
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:59,701
- and those mini-cupcakes?
- Mini-cupcakes?

51
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:02,621
As in the mini version
of regular cupcakes,

52
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,373
which is already
a mini version of cake?

53
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,876
Honestly, where does it end
with you people?

54
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,528
What about an authentic
Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas?

55
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:12,330
Drink some <i>gluhwein,</i>

56
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:13,882
enjoy some <i>hasenpfeffer.</i>

57
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,551
Enjoy Christmas
with Saint Nicolas'

58
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:19,370
rural German companion,
Belsnickel.

59
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:22,424
Yes!
That, that, that!

60
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,926
We're definitely doing that.
Are we all in agreement?

61
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:25,977
- No.
- No!

62
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,562
- Done, right?
- No.

63
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:28,930
I want tropical Christmas.

64
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,766
- Topless Christmas.
- Tapas Swiss miss!

65
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:35,153
Spanish tapas
and Swiss miss hot cocoa--

66
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:36,955
what's so hard to understand?

67
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,724
Or, who was it that suggested

68
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,409
the authentic
Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas?

69
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:42,744
I think
it was someone really popular.

70
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,562
- We already said no.
- No, no, no.

71
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,830
Too weird.

72
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,082
This is me and my family

73
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:48,500
celebrating
Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas

74
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,335
in 1982 on the farm.

75
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,070
There's me and my brother jeb

76
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,905
breaking
the ceremonial pig rib.

77
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,508
He doesn't come back
for Christmas anymore.

78
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:59,577
The sepia tint
is from an app on my phone.

79
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:03,848
This is the same photo,
<i>Matrix</i> style.

80
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,300
I'm not understanding
the confusion.

81
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,685
Am I the only one
who wants to try

82
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,054
hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen,

83
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,254
and meet this glenpickle guy?

84
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:11,523
[Shrill whistle blows]

85
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,808
Party planning committee,
emergency meeting.

86
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,445
Now.

87
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,764
- I'm on it.
- Right.

88
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,932
I'm just hoping
German terrorists

89
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,350
don't take over
this Christmas party.

90
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:24,736
Make me go
all John McClane on their asses.

91
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,155
Wait, German terrorists?
That's oddly specific.

92
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,624
And I think--
I think you mean John McCain.

93
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:31,442
<i>Die Hard</i> reference.

94
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,878
- I haven't seen it.
- You haven't seen <i>Die Hard?</i>

95
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,047
- Mm-mmm.
- Why haven't you seen <i>Die Hard?</i>

96
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,083
I don't know, I just haven't.

97
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,451
Come on, you had to have
at least seen some of it.

98
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:41,469
No.

99
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:44,723
"Now, I have a machine gun.

100
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,674
Ho, ho, ho."

101
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,226
[As Bruce Willis]
"Come out to the coast,

102
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,178
we'll get together,
have a few laughs."

103
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,480
None of this
makes any sense to me!

104
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,983
Oh, yeah, and when he takes
the gun off his back,

105
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,569
and he's like,
"yippie-ki-yay, mother--"

106
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,687
Actually,
he doesn't say that there.

107
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,025
He says it earlier when
he's on the radio with Hans.

108
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,644
Yes, you are right.
Forgive me.

109
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,747
- Oh, that's okay, bud.
- Nope.

110
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,582
- Common mistake.
- No, it's not.

111
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,200
Nerd!

112
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,318
Do you know
every line of the movie?

113
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,087
My brother dared me
to memorize it,

114
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,923
and I did it,
and I loved doing it.

115
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,992
Okay, let's hear it.

116
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,294
- Hear what?
- <i>Die Hard.</i>

117
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:25,663
Every line.
Go.

118
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,931
You don't like flying, do you?

119
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,017
Don't change the subject.

120
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,552
No, that's the--

121
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:31,970
Movie is starting.

122
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,504
We're thinking of collaborating

123
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,356
with Mike Schmidt
on some of his charity work.

124
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:37,892
I love Philly.
Dirty town.

125
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:40,812
Ah-ha-ha!
Philly!

126
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:44,199
- Exciting stuff, man.
- Whoo!

127
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,350
So you sure you remembered
everything for your trip?

128
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:50,321
- Yeah, I think so.
- Think that through for a sec.

129
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:52,157
Yeah, Jim's going
to Philly tomorrow.

130
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,408
He said he was gonna
take me with him,

131
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,876
but that was two months ago.

132
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,445
And I haven't heard
anything since.

133
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,515
I mean, he said that, right?

134
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:03,218
What else could you possibly
be forgetting?

135
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:06,037
- Uh--
- Things? People?

136
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,538
[Chuckles nervously]

137
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,424
You know who's not
gonna get to work

138
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,042
on some exciting
new startup this year?

139
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,311
George Howard Skub,

140
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:16,264
AKA the alleged
Scranton strangler,

141
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,266
because he's in prison

142
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,218
for something
he may not have done.

143
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,904
I'm sorry, the--
uh, the Scranton who?

144
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:25,573
The Scranton strangler.
George Howard Skub.

145
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:26,891
Haven't I told you
about the jury

146
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,026
I was on a couple years ago?

147
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,328
[Gasps] Oh, what happened?

148
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:31,830
I mean, if you can
talk about it, obviously.

149
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,031
Because if you can't,
I mean, I understand.

150
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:37,168
I-- I could--
I could talk about it.

151
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,402
See you next Christmas.

152
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,704
I could, sure.
Have a seat.

153
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,422
I would start at the beginning,

154
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:45,510
but I think I need
to go farther back.

155
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,595
We're the party
planning committee,

156
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,297
and we did not get where we are

157
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,765
by playing it safe.

158
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,717
We got here
by being risk takers.

159
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,969
And, yeah,

160
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,856
Dwight's party
is gonna be terrible.

161
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,608
Maybe.

162
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:04,028
Maybe it's not.

163
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,947
Maybe it's going to be great.

164
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:11,486
And, if it's great...

165
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,954
I think we all know

166
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:17,275
what that would mean to us.

167
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,127
Let's do it.

168
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,962
Yes.
Phyllis!

169
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:22,297
No.

170
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:24,132
I don't want my name
attached to this party.

171
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,133
What does that even mean?

172
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,284
Where would your name appear?

173
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,302
Please just take my name

174
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:28,419
off of everything.

175
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:31,589
Just take her name
off of everything.

176
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,174
[Clears throat]

177
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,760
The party planning committee,
minus Angela,

178
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:41,349
has decided that we're all going
to do Dwight's Christmas.

179
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,850
Yes!
Yeah!

180
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,903
Yeah!
Okay!

181
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,355
Yes!
It's a Christmas miracle!

182
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,823
Yeah!

183
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:51,192
- Whoo-hoo!
- Dwight, there is one rule

184
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,027
that you need
to take very seriously.

185
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,946
- Uh-huh.
- And that is...

186
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,080
Uh-oh.

187
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,498
That there are no rules.

188
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:01,319
You have never been cooler.

189
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,204
Best Christmas ever.

190
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:06,507
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

191
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:16,330
And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas
has officially begun.

192
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,966
Ugh.
What is this stuff, lava?

193
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:21,952
That is <i>gluhwein,</i>
<i>otherwise known as glow-wine,</i>

194
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,921
also used to sterilize
medical instruments.

195
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:26,891
And, interesting factoid,

196
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,477
this is the very spoon
that guided my soft skull

197
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:31,846
through the birth canal
when I was born.

198
00:07:31,897 --> 00:07:33,798
- Enjoy.
- What is it?

199
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:35,933
Don't touch it.

200
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,820
- Somebody's found the hog maw.
- Oh!

201
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:39,904
What?

202
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:41,305
It's a Pennsylvania
Dutch specialty.

203
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:43,107
Hog maw.
That's a beauty, isn't it?

204
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:44,942
I don't even want
to tell you what it's made of

205
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:46,477
until after you try it.

206
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:48,579
Ugh.
I'm not eating mystery meat.

207
00:07:48,614 --> 00:07:50,198
It is stuffed pig stomach.

208
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:52,667
And, after we finish it,
we get to break the pig rib.

209
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:54,035
- Can't wait.
- Weird.

210
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:55,653
Where are the sugar cookies?

211
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:57,338
Where's the karaoke machine?

212
00:07:57,372 --> 00:07:59,156
This is austere, Meredith.

213
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:03,177
This is celebrating Christmas
for all of the right reasons.

214
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:06,848
The cookies and toys and sweets
are mere distractions.

215
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:08,999
I mean, most people
don't even know

216
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,385
that a candy cane
represents a shepherd's crook,

217
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,855
which I assure you
does not taste like peppermint.

218
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,339
It tastes like sheep feces.

219
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:16,724
How would anyone even know--

220
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:18,175
Have you ever tasted
a shepherd's crook?

221
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,944
I don't know.
Is it what you expected?

222
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:23,397
I feel like--
Dwight is holding a candle

223
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,867
and reading a poem.

224
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:29,620
So happy right now.

225
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:33,858
[Speaking German]

226
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:35,409
Wait, what is that I hear?

227
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,861
Is someone on the roof?

228
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,746
How strange.

229
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:41,666
Excuse me.
I have to run to my car

230
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,201
to take a dump.

231
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:48,539
I wish my car had a bathroom.

232
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:49,874
"Let Heinrich
plant the detonators

233
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:51,142
and Theo prepare the vault.

234
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:53,594
- After that--"
- Eh. That wasn't the line.

235
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:55,429
I'm sorry, Pete.

236
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:57,115
That is transcribed
by some fan.

237
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:58,616
They make mistakes.

238
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,285
I don't know.
This looks pretty legit.

239
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:02,670
[Cell phone chimes]

240
00:09:02,704 --> 00:09:05,656
Oh, my gosh.
I just got an email from Andy.

241
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:07,592
That means they hit land.

242
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:09,961
"What up, shorty?
We got in last night,

243
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:13,264
sold the boat,
went out, got drunk,

244
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:16,350
saw <i>Life of Pi,</i>
<i>got super depressed</i>

245
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:18,803
and introspective.

246
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:21,038
Gonna hang out here a while.

247
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:22,824
Maybe a couple of weeks.

248
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:26,043
Figure
this whole life thing out.

249
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,430
Maybe see <i>Hobbit.</i>
<i>Lates."</i>

250
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,851
Hey.
Everything okay?

251
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:36,220
So what comes next?

252
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:39,941
Right, um, okay.

253
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,743
So he says,
"after we call the police,

254
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:44,779
they'll waste hours
trying to negotiate--"

255
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,447
We should just watch the movie.

256
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:47,565
That makes much more sense.

257
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,784
Or we can just sit
and talk, though.

258
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:50,868
No.
No more talking.

259
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:51,919
It's movie time.

260
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:55,590
I mean, are you sure...

261
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:58,409
Yeah, I probably have
a copy or two in my car.

262
00:09:58,427 --> 00:09:59,877
Oh, great.
Great!

263
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:01,512

watching <i>Die Hard,</i> now.

Okay.

Here's the thing
about moonlight.

00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:09,086
It's not sunlight.

I love this hog mama.

I am nigh!

278
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:29,940
Every year, my grandfather
would dress up as Belsnickel

279
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:30,958
at Christmas.

280
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:34,462
He was... okay at it.

281
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:36,581
I am great.

282
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,449
You know how they say some
people were born to be bad?

283
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:42,003
Well, I was born
to be Belsnickel.

284
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:44,005
Ohh, Belsnickel

285
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:46,257
has traveled from distant lands

286
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,459
to discover how
all the boys and the girls

287
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:50,478
have been behaving
this last year.

288
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:53,764
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Ohh... too much strudel.

289
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:56,851
So he's kind of like Santa,
except dirty and worse.

290
00:10:56,902 --> 00:10:58,802
No, much better--
no one fears Santa

291
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,655
the way they fear Belsnickel.

292
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,356
Wow. It's my favorite
part of Christmas.

293
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:03,407
The authority.

294
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:05,359
- And the fear.
- Yes, exactly!

295
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,278
Come on, Dwight,
you're making this up.

296
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:09,363
- No...
- This is a real thing.

"Belsnickel is a crotchety,
fur-clad gift giver

in Dwight's traditions,

to every outmoded aspect

of our traditions.

310

You gotta stick to your word!

to a buddy,

00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:18,699
what are you gonna do, lie?

No, these are gift bowls.

When you receive a gift,
it will go in the bowl,

329

but the bowls must be
returned at the end.

330
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:31,412
They're a set.

331
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:34,498
Now, hold your bowls forward.

332
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:38,169
The Belsnickel will decide
if you are impish

or admirable.

No, impish or admirable.

Quick question--
do you just decide

337
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,044
who gets what in the moment,
or did you make a list?

338
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:49,546
- I decided earlier.
- Oh. Nice.

339
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,715
- Did you check that list?
- Of course I checked it.

But more than once? 'Cause you
could have made a mistake.

- Okay, so you made a list,

you checked it twice, and now
you're gonna find out who's--

Impish or admirable.

I judge your year as...
