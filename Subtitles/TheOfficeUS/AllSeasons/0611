1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,300
Not again.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,600
Bow down before recyclops.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,030
Five years ago,corporate said

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,870
we had to start a recycling
program for earth day.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,190
So dwight took the lead
on that and introduced us

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,920
to a very close friend
of his named recyclops.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,610
Happy earth day,everyone,i'm recyclops.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,300
Did you know that an old milk carton

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,520
can be sawed in half
and used as a planter?

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,820
The next year he really
stepped things up.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,950
Who has put a number seven
plastic in a number four bin?

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,340
A year after that,recyclops
really began to take shape.

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,000
Recyclops will drown you
in your overwatered lawns.

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,700
Then tragedy struck recyclops

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,820
when his fictional planet was attacked
by some other fictitious thing.

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,010
I can't remember.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,900
Recyclops will have his revenge.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,090
I think this was also the year
that he renounced earth day

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,220
and vowed to destroy
the planet he once loved.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,810
Oh,my god,you guys,look,it's recyclops!

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,630
Recyclops destroys!

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,210
- Oh,is today recyclops day?
- Yes.

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,100
I thought you were killed
by polluticorn or something.

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,990
Polluticorn wishes.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,390
That's aerosol spray.

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,870
It's terrible for th environment.

27
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,390
Humans are terrible for the environment.

28
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,900
The thing I like most about recyclops

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,700
ishat he's creating a
different world for our child.

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,670
A world where you truly
can be anything you want.

31
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,670
God bless you,recyclops
and your cold robot heart.

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,650
Okay,okay,how about this?

36
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,810
- That's great.
- I want it to be better than great,pam.

37
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,230
How about I remain seated and I just do a
little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,360
Sure.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,760
No,then my face is down
and they can't see my face.

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,070
And it looks like you're taking a dump.

41
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,980
Alan brand is the ceo of the company,

42
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,890
if title's important to you,

43
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,910
has personally invited moi to go to
new york to the shareholder's meeting

44
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,380
and sit up on the stage
with the board of directors.

45
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,120
And at some point they
are going to introduce me

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,680
as the most successful
branch manager that they have.

47
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,820
And then michael scott turns and waves
to the crowd and the crowd goes wild.

48
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,240
Ladies and gentleman,from
scranton pennsylvania,

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,000
please welcome michael
"the machine" scott.

50
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,370
- Don't do the twirl.
- Lose the twirl.

51
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,220
- Twirl sucks.
- Michael,I hated the twirl.

52
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,540
Hate the twirl.

53
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,780
Okay,obviously,I'm not
going to do the twirl.

54
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,710
I only did it cacause I nailed the wave.

55
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,190
Yeah,good,don't do it.

56
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,490
I'm not going to do
the twirl. All right?

57
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,930
It's not even a twirl,it's a spin.

58
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,390
I might do the spin.

59
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,980
The long term problem is bad
investments that they need to dump.

60
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,890
The short term problem is the company

61
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,700
has no cash and there's
nowhere to get it.

62
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,680
Okay,oscar,I don't need the whole
enchilada just bullet points.

63
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,730
Those are the bullet points.

64
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,350
Well,could you condense it please?

65
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,850
That's as simple as I can make it.

66
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,280
Michael,the limo's here for you.

67
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,890
It's not a limo,it's a town car.

68
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,280
Town car's are actually better though,

69
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,080
better torque,better handling.

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,480
He said limousine so...

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,850
Check it out,guys.
There's a limo down here.

72
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,220
Michael,look.

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,060
Oh,man.

74
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,650
They sent a limo.

75
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,760
Town cars suck. A town car is something
that a company sends when they're in trouble.

76
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
A limousine is something
that a company sends

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,640
when they have cse for celebration.

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,840
And in this case,I think
we are celebrating me.

79
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,390
Oh,wait! Wait!

80
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,910
wo Wow!

81
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,270
Ohoh,no way. Look at that.

82
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,420
What kind of mileage does this baby get?

83
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,570
It's like what high school
kids take to prom on tv shows.

84
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,200
This is so typical of management
to spend money on this.

85
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,110
Uh,they're a bunch of boobs.

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,680
Hate to break it to you,oscar,but
some of us like boobs.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,660
Calves,calves all the way.

88
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,970
I'i'm so jealous right now.

89
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,660
Hey,you know who you should be jealousf?

90
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,120
Yourself because you're
invited,and you're invited,

91
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,410
and you're invited,and you,and
you,and you,and you,and you,and you...

92
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,830
Car seats eight. And you...

93
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,360
- What?
- The car seats eight.

94
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,620
The limo seats eight. Okay,then
jim and pam,and ryan plus a guest.

95
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,570
- No thanks.
- no.

96
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,840
I'll use it when you're done.

97
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,440
I'll go...

98
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,050
me.

99
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,760
The dunder mifflin stock symbol is dmi.

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,240
Do you know what that stands for?

101
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,110
Dummies,morons and idiots

102
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,860
because that's what you'd
have to be to own it.

103
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,490
And as one of those idiots,I
believe the board owes me answers.

104
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,510
I wish the windows weren't tinted
so people could see us in here.

105
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,500
Hey guys,do you thinknynyone
might have had sex in here?

106
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,610
- Definitely.
- Sounds like it.

107
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,920
Definitely. Look,they got pillows.

108
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,320
That,that's bigger than my bed.

109
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,940
- Word!
- Yeah,yeah!

110
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,620
Who's playing with the button?

111
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,810
Hey,ryan,could you start consolidating

112
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,690
all of our rolodex
information into outlook?

113
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,760
Uh,itoeoesn't seem like there's much
of a point if the company's going under.

114
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,960
But if the company doesn't go under,

115
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,630
then we'll finally have all
our contacts in one program.

116
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,490
- The company's probably going under though.
- It could go either way.

117
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,830
Seems like it's leaning one way.

118
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,100
Maybe we should just wait and find out

119
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,200
- definitely.
- Okay.

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,530
So should we wait to find out
before we start doing all this stuff?

121
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,410
Nah,might as well do it now.

122
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,990
Michael,what if somebody asks
you a question at this meeting?

123
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,470
Are you just gonna wave or what?

124
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,770
I will have to answer.

125
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,890
I'll ask you a question.

126
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,070
Make it a softball.

127
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,520
Something he can,like,crank
out of the park.

128
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,860
Michael scott,you run
ththe most profitable branch

129
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,990
of dunder mifflin,how do you do it?

130
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,290
No,no,that's too hard.

131
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,900
Say you're name is
zamboni and I will say,

132
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,520
"well,we're sort of on thin ice.

133
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,160
" I won't say that,i'll
say something like that.

134
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,410
This is your big day,come on.

135
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,280
Oh,my god. This is it.

136
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,020
- Mr. Scott?
- Yes.

137
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,390
- I'm laurie.
- Oh,hi.

138
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,820
Thank you for joining us. Come with me.

139
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,360
Well,thank you and please call me...

140
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,050
Continue to call me mr. Scott.

141
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,140
Okay.

142
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,150
If you just wanna follow me
i'll take you up to the lounge.

143
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,500
Well,I guess that's as far
as I can take yoguys. So...

144
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,150
- Good luck,michael.
- See you later.

145
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,350
Officers. Thank you.

146
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,200
- Here is the lounge.
- Thank you.

147
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,410
- Michael.
- Hello.

148
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,760
- So glad you could make it.
- Thank you.

149
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,920
- How was the ride?
- Oh,it was awesome. Very,very sublime.

150
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,240
I'm glad. I want to
introduce you to everyone.

151
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,060
Uh,first we'll start with alan brand.

152
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,970
Alan,ceo,michael
scott,branch manager,scranton.

153
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,090
- It's nice to meet you michael.
- Nice to meet you too.

154
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,100
It's an honor and a privilege.

155
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,510
And seated we have the former
congressman chris o'keefe.

156
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,720
Ah,your eminence.

157
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,100
For those of you with questions,

158
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,530
please line up behind one
of the four microphones

159
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,880
that have been placed in the isle.

160
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,890
Coming through.

161
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,230
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

162
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,630
H,h,damn it.

163
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,140
What... Okay.

164
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,200
I was hoping to lob michael
a soft ball question early.

165
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,140
I wanted to swing by
the garment district

166
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,350
and pick up a few crates of my shirts.

167
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,140
I got a shirt guy.

168
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,140
Can you believe this?

169
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,800
The money theypent on
this convention hall.

170
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240
Excuse me,miss.

171
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,980
I just want to take those stupid
board of directors by their necks.

172
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,990
This is so simple.

173
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,170
Oh,yeah. Well,you should
do that. Get in line.

174
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,510
Oh,what a great idea and
lose my job. No,thank you.

175
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,030
Look,don't you wanna be
able to tell your grandkids

176
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,160
you stood up for yourself during
america's biggest financial crisis?

177
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,310
How is he gonna have grandkids?

178
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,530
You guys ever protect the president?

179
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,710
no.

180
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,190
What about madonna?

181
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,470
Obama twins? Anybody famous?

182
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,130
Not supposed to talk about it.

183
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,550
Nelly furtado.

184
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,220
All right,guys.

185
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,260
Are you ready?

186
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,540
Rock and roll

187
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,930
all: boo!

188
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,890
**** Company.

189
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:31,150
We are poised to come through this more
streamlin a and profitable than ever.

190
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,240
This is not as much fun
as I thoug I it would be.

191
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,500
It was fun when we weren't
on the brink of bankruptcy.

192
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,430
We're going bankrupt,you think?

193
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,160
They are really angry.

194
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,590
I'm just gonna run to the
bathroom,will you save my place?

195
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,740
- Sure.
- no. You will not.

196
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,810
Excuse me?

197
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,870
Oh,I'm sorry,were you raised in
a household with no consequences?

198
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,270
It'll just be a second.

199
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,680
Oh,if onlys and justs
were candies and nuts

200
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,400
then everyday would be erntedankfest.

201
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,890
There are many things to be optimistic
about in dunder mifflin's future.

202
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,980
And one of them is here with us today.

203
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,210
Michael scott,scranton branch manager.

204
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,250
Yes!

205
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,440
In these uncertain
times michael has managed

206
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,160
to maintain steady profits
from the scranton branch.

207
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,230
We all thank you,michael.

208
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,130
Another bright spot in the
dunder mifflin landscape

209
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,640
our new waste-pulp
re-purposing plant in milford.

210
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,400
Hey,phyllis,are you just
getting back from lunch now?

211
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,340
Bob took me to capello's.
We got a little tipsy.

212
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,810
Okay,shouldn't be telling me that stuff

213
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,670
and also shouldn't be taking two
hour lunches without telling me.

214
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,580
Oh,it's okay,michael esesn't
really care about these things.

215
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,010
I care about 'em and I'm just
as much of a boss as michael.

216
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,100
What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.

217
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,700
That doesn't make you a boss.

218
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,030
It's not like you can
fire people or anything.

219
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,500
Well,who... How did
you... Who told you this?

220
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
- We can't say.
- Ryan.

221
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,930
Sorry,I'm plastered.

222
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,950
Okay,who else has heard the rumor

223
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,120
that I am not as much
in charge as michael?

224
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,390
Stuff gets around. I don't participate.

225
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,460
Who here heard it from ryan?

226
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,720
Does an email count?

227
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,910
- Yes.
- Then yeah.

228
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,260
I am just as much of a boss as michael

229
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,500
and I can do anything that
michael can do. All right.

230
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,720
Who here believes that I
have as much power as michael?

231
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,130
I forgot I have to
support him no matter what.

232
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,710
Close one.

233
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,590
These questions are bush league.

234
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,370
You should get up and say something.

235
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,560
You gotta be true to what's
in there. Don't be a wuss.

236
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,050
I've always been the guy who
can rally other people to rebel.

237
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,160
In high school,I organized a walk
out over standardized testing.

238
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,490
Got over 500 students
j just skip the sats.

239
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,740
At the last second I chickened
out,took it anyway,got a 1220.

240
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,600
Always regretted it.

241
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,990
I feel lachrymose.

242
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,320
Believe me,everyone
is working very hard,

243
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,470
working weekends,struggling,trying
to right the ship.

244
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,940
You're criminals!

245
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,870
Hey,hey! I'm sorry
these are not criminals.

246
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,320
They're nice.

247
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,760
They invited me to come here today,

248
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,500
they invited me to
their hospitality suite,

249
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,430
where I had free
food,and it was delicious.

250
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,560
Get this,you know how nice they are?

251
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,670
They sent a stretch limo all the
way to pick me up in scranton.

252
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,850
- Limousine?
- Yes.

253
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,240
You're all corrupt.
You should be in jail!

254
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,570
Quiet! Quiet,please!
Please,quiet! Quiet,please.

255
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,590
We want to hear your questions.

256
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,420
Do you love her,or do
you love the idea of her?

257
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,810
I don't know,man. I just don't know.

258
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,870
I gotta make an example out of him.

259
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,030
Should I just fire him?

260
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,780
Can you actually fire people?

261
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,080
To be honest,I don't know.

262
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,630
But maybe I could just yell
at him in front of people.

263
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,990
Well,I can't really imagine
you yelling at anyone.

264
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,130
Oh,I yell. You've heard me yell.

265
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,290
Okay. I've heard you exclaim.

266
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,630
Like the time you said,"hey
look,we parked over here.

267
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,100
" well,that was apple picking day.
There's no need to yell that day.

268
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,170
You know,I was just
excited to find the car.

269
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,530
Perfect end to a perfect day.

270
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,870
Well,you'll figure it out.

271
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,180
Okay,we're gonna take a 15-minute break

272
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,300
and then we're gonna
answer more questions.

273
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,010
You haven't said anything yet
and we're headed rr bankruptcy.

274
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,320
Yeah,well,that's not gonna happen.

275
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,310
That's not gonna happen.
We'll be back with se answers.

276
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,330
What? What answers?

277
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,890
I... Okay,I know,that you're mad at
me and you're mad at all of them...

278
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,470
How are you gonna fix the company?

279
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,950
Okay...

280
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,190
All right,we are gonna...

281
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,830
We're gonna go out
there during this break

282
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,860
and we are gonna come back with a plan.

283
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,600
We're gonna come back
with a plan for you.

284
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,770
It's a 45-day plan.

285
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,210
45 days to get us back on track.

286
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,730
Yeah!

287
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,770
45 points.

288
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,650
It's a
45-day,45-point...

289
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,860
One point per day...

290
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,180
We get 45 points we're back in business.

291
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,100
And you can take that to the bank.

292
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,810
And limo lady,we are going
completely carbon neutral.

293
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,770
I love you,new york!

294
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,370
*** How's it go...

295
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,580
Here's the thing,um,I've tried it like
five different ways in my head and...

296
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,540
Oh,got one,um,I'm such a perfectionist

297
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,950
that I'd kinda rather not do it
at all,than do a crappy version.

298
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,560
Simple data entry though,so
there's really only oneay to do it.

299
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,600
Sounds like you have a
really specific vision for it.

300
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,990
Do you wanna,maybe,just
take a whack at it?

301
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,310
- You know what?
- What?

302
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,680
- I think I know the problem.
- Great.

303
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,880
I think you seem distracted.

304
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,370
Yep,that is the problem.

305
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,010
And you know what,I came up with something
and I think it's really gonna help.

306
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,760
Well,I'm glad you're
finally being proactive,jim.

307
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,790
I am too. Let me show you.

308
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,090
Wow,things are really picking up.

309
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,110
- What was that about?
- What?

310
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,880
You were suppose to wave.

311
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,780
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.

312
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,160
What are we suppose to tell them now?

313
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,620
Okay,you've dug us quite a hole.

314
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,890
We tell them the plan. Right?

315
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,850
There is no plan.

316
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,290
Here's what we're gonna do.

317
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,480
The 45-day thing that I
outlined,we go with that.

318
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,340
Day 45 company saved. Day 44,go.

319
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,960
What have we got? We have 15 minutes.

320
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,410
Excuse me?

321
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,800
Just whatever comes
to mind,shout it out.

322
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,950
Who the hell is this guy?

323
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,390
I am the guy who roused that crowed...

324
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,630
- Yes...
- Got 'em on their feet.

325
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,280
- They were so happy down there.
- Yes. Who cares?

326
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,800
Okay,all right.

327
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,360
Well,I know a guy... This mexican guy.

328
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,020
Is a math whiz,he knows economics
as well as he knows bullfighting

329
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,430
and I am going to
call in a little favor.

330
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,300
No,no,don't call anybody,michael.

331
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,390
Well,I'm texting him so...

332
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,780
Please do not text anybody now. Michael.

333
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,190
It's done.

334
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,720
Oh,there he is. Come on in. Come on in.

335
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,980
Gentleman,I would like u to meet
oscar... Come on in. Don't be shy.

336
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,060
This is oscar martinez.

337
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,840
Oscar,why don't you come
over here? Let me present you.

338
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,480
Step up,step up there.

339
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,850
Oscar is an accountant
extraordinaire at the scranton branch

340
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,440
and he has a wonderful idea as to

341
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,340
how to get us out of this murky
murky situation. Take it away.

342
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,080
I think this is really gonna help.

343
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,000
If you can just hold up here one second.

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,120
Hey,guys,just a quick announcement.
If I could have everyone's attention.

345
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,630
I just figured you needed a place

346
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,440
where you could concentrate and
not be bothered by bothering people.

347
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,280
- Okay.
- Let me show you what I mean.

348
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,460
Your new office.

349
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,500
How great is that,right?
For a job well done.

350
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,980
Well... Not done.

351
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,750
I will,uh,I will do my work right now.

352
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,020
- I will stay late tonight.
- Right.

353
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,690
Um,I'm very sorry about everything.

354
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,460
You're a good kid. You kn what,it
gets bigger once you're in there.

355
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,700
Enjoy it.

356
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,670
Is there internet?

357
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,360
Um...

358
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,660
Tell them what you
told me. This is genius.

359
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,270
Tell them about the cash flow.

360
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:13,260
And the dumping of
properties and this is all...

361
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,090
It's all good,it's all good stuff.

362
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,200
Lay it on 'em.

363
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,730
I feel,as does Mr. Scott,that we are
in the best of hands,uh,capable hands...

364
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,420
That wasn't what you were sayin' to me.

365
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,690
He was much more articulate
and that was better.

366
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,990
- Much better.
- I think this has gone very well.

367
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,590
I... And I thank you.

368
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,170
Okay...

369
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,190
Hey,hey. What are you doing?

370
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,390
Michael,I didn'ask to come up here.

371
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,500
Wow,man,that... That was embarrassing.

372
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,080
- For me.
- For me too.

373
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,360
- For you?
- You embarrassed me.

374
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,420
You...

375
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,960
Well...

376
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,240
That was a waste of a text.

377
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,760
Let's get down to brass tacks.

378
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,880
I think that we might be in trouble.

379
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,910
We don't seem to have
a plan so I'm thinking,

380
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,150
I go down there,maybe rattle off a
few jokes congressman could follow.

381
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,450
He's our best manager?

382
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,970
Where's the off button on this moron?

383
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,020
Uh,I'm not a moron.

384
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,780
Time after time,my
branch leads in sales,

385
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,190
I have personally won over 17
dundee awards,so I am not a moron.

386
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,580
And I'm just trying to help,you
know,so you're the moron.

387
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,330
Yes,it is a thrill to be
honored by one's company.

388
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,580
To have the people that you
work for stop for a minute

389
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,230
and say,"wow,great job.

390
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,550
That's what it's about.

391
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,930
" he canaake the bus.

392
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,110
He's had his limo ride.

393
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,300
That is what it's all
about,not the perks.

394
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,520
The perks... The perks,I
could take or leave the perks.

395
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,830
Oscar! Oscar,come on!

396
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,330
But limos are for people
who make the company money

397
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,490
not lose millions and have no plan.

398
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,780
So we're leaving early.

399
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,240
Woo-hoo!
Go,go,go,go,go,go,go! Go,go,go!

400
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,390
Did you steaththat?

401
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,520
After all,we are the only ones
with anything to celebrate.

402
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,070
All:
scranton,scranton,scranton,scranton!

403
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,600
Dunder mifflin!

404
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,640
The gentleman in the, uh, glasses...

405
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,800
Dwight Shrute... Scranton branch.

406
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,910
I just want to say that I have been 
standing in this line, all day...

407
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,520
And if this line is any indication 
of how this company is being run,

408
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,280
...then we are in big trouble!

409
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,940
Yes!   I know!
And I just wanna say...

410
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,380
That I believe that 
there are options out there...

411
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,940
A 'take-a-number' option, 
like they have in a deli...

412
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,830
What about line varieties?

413
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,510
Like an express line...

414
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:14,300
For quick comments, of ten words or less -
they could move much more efficiently.

415
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,870
What about ropes, along the lines, 
that you can hold on to?

416
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,320
<i>Thank you...

417
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,920
Thank you for your suggestion.

418
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,480
Yes.
