1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,366
I am actually looking forward to
"Take Your Daughter to Work Day. "

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,304
I am not great with kids,
but I wanna get better

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,505
because I'm getting married.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,676
So I put out a bunch
of extra candy on my desk

5
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,838
so the kids will come
talk to me.

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,982
Like the witch
in Hansel and Gretel.

7
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,152
Bribery. Nice.
Oh, I have more.

8
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,685
Name's Pam.
Miss Beesly, if you're nasty.

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,725
Janet Jackson. Hey, you having
a wardrobe malfunction there...

10
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,627
Michael, you can't be nasty
today. Because of that.

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,125
Oh, God. Is that today?
I reminded you last night.

12
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,798
Listen, I like kids.

13
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,461
But this is not
a kids' environment.

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,267
This is like HBO. No limits.

15
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,941
Who knows what I'm
gonna say? Crazy stuff.

16
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,135
And it is "R" rated.
It is not rated "G."

17
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,045
I am like Eddie Murphy in Raw.

18
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,114
And they are trying
to make me

19
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,674
into Eddie Murphy
in Daddy Day Care.

20
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,879
Both great movies, but still.

21
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,516
Well, I'll be in my office.

22
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,615
Don't you think you should
say something? They're cool.

23
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,717
Michael, I think that as
the boss you should really...

24
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,730
Fine, fine, fine, fine,
fine, fine. Hi, children.

25
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:09,958
I'm Michael Scott and I
am in charge of this place.

26
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,171
How do I make
you understand...

27
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,639
I am like Superman.

28
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,307
And the people who work here
are like citizens of Gotham City.

29
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,607
That's Batman.
That's Batman.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,706
Okay. I'm Aquaman.
Where does he live, guys?

31
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,943
The ocean.

32
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,452
I work with a bunch of nerds.

33
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,787
Hello, tiny one.
Come on.

34
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,691
You are the future.

35
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,406
This is my file cabinet.

36
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,244
Oh, this is the partition

37
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,716
between my desk and Angela's.

38
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,720
Abby's my fiancee Stacey's
daughter.

39
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,452
I think she'll have
a good time.

40
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,052
I just hope she doesn't
look on my computer.

41
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,729
Actually, I better go check.

42
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,901
Michael, you remember
my daughter, Melissa.

43
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,702
Oh, yes. Hello, how are you?
Good to see you.

44
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,606
Wow, you've really grown up.

45
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,004
You know what? If you
don't mind me saying so,

46
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,445
she is turning into
a stone cold fox.

47
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,416
Better keep the frat boys
away from her.

48
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,442
I'm in eighth grade.

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,987
She's in middle school.

50
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,024
Yeah, middle school's amazing.
It is extraordinary.

51
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,682
An extraordinary time.

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,625
It's not that children
make me uncomfortable.

53
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,755
It's just that, why be a dad
when you can be a fun uncle?

54
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,800
I've never heard of anyone
rebelling against their fun uncle.

55
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,235
They want how many
spiral pads? Well, 50...

56
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,266
I over-ordered because
they had a back-order.

57
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,330
Okay.

58
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,933
I got permission
to bring Jakey in to work.

59
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,638
Which is great because
he got suspended this week

60
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,977
and now I don't have
to pay for a sitter.

61
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,250
Will you pull that
down there?

62
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,247
Okay, tell them
what you wanted to say.

63
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,449
Do you need any help? No. Thanks.

64
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,316
We'd have to explain
everything.

65
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,260
It's probably just easier
if we do it ourselves.

66
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,394
All right, I wasn't
expecting that. Let's go draw.

67
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,526
Oh, my God. She is so cute
I wanna die.

68
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,629
Don't you just love kids,
Angela?

69
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,839
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair
of small, well-behaved boys.

70
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,004
God, I cannot wait to get
pregnant and have babies.

71
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,376
Kelly and I both agreed
that we would just have fun.

72
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,942
And I'm learning
that fun for Kelly

73
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,012
is getting married
and having babies,

74
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,157
immediately, with me.

75
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,690
Just compare last year's order
to this year's.

76
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,958
Yeah, I'm looking at it
right now.

77
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,968
Yes.

78
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,765
We...

79
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,400
Yeah, they're very...

80
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,006
They're different.

81
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,511
Yeah, we can stick
with last year's,

82
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,881
we're just gonna have
to supplement it, somehow.

83
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,150
Hey, Abby, do you wanna help
me shred some old documents?

84
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,351
It's actually pretty cool. No thanks.

85
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,027
I only have one goal today.
To make one kid like me.

86
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,791
Just one.

87
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,432
What are you reading?

88
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,472
From the Mixed-Up Files
of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.

89
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,798
Best book.

90
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,841
Yeah, but I've read
it before. So have I.

91
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,638
Hey, question:

92
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,544
If you had to spend
the night in the Met

93
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,446
or the aquarium,
which would it be?

94
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:21,009
Definitely the aquarium.
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that.

95
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,355
You don't wanna help me
with some of my sales, do you?

96
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,755
'Cause I'm kind of swamped.

97
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,293
Sure.
Really? Yes.

98
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,925
And you're Abby, right?
Yeah.

99
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,122
I'm Jim.

100
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,666
And, let's sell some paper. All right.

101
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,726
Let's start with your mom.

102
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,466
Yes. Well, we can...

103
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,073
Hey, you know what? Can I call
you back? I'll call you right back.

104
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,442
Yes, I promise.

105
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,615
Hello. Can I help you?

106
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,156
You can pick that up if
you want. That's all right.

107
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,388
You wanna bring it over...

108
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,487
Here, I'll make some room.

109
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:15,232
My name's Michael.
What's your name? Sasha.

110
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,639
Nice to meet you.

111
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,704
Oh, you know what that is?
That is a train whistle.

112
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,541
Like I'm the conductor.

113
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,310
But I'm sort of the conductor
of the office here. Right?

114
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,280
You wanna try?
Sure.

115
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,746
All aboard for sales!

116
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,525
Next stop, Kukabonga.

117
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,994
You broke my hand!
There is no way that hurt.

118
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,592
Really? 'Cause she's
pretty strong, Dwight.

119
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,729
Little girl, come over here.

120
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,373
Shake my hand.

121
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,810
Come on.
I don't have all day.

122
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,707
I don't feel anything.
Nothing. You're so weak.

123
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,787
Excuse me. These are expensive
collectors' items, okay?

124
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,186
Do you have
any computer games?

125
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,660
No, I don't have computer
games on my work computer.

126
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,718
That would
be inappropriate.

127
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,789
Yeah, Meredith doesn't have
any either. It's so lame here.

128
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,427
You call your mom, Meredith?
That's very disrespectful.

129
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,198
Whatever, okay?

130
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,772
You can refer to me
as Mr. Schrute.

131
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,340
That's your name?

132
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,301
Mr. Poop?
Schrute.

133
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,271
Mr. Schrute.
Sure, Mr. Poop.

134
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,912
Schrute.

135
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,290
Are you Mother Goose?

136
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,794
I drink like a hundred iced macchiatos
a day and practically nothing else.

137
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:49,892
Wow.

138
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,427
There's a really cool coffee place,
Jitterz, at the Steamtown Mall.

139
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,474
You ever been there?
No.

140
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,507
You've never been to Jitterz?
Ryan, you are so dorky.

141
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,277
Give me your number
so I can text you.

142
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,713
Come on.

143
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,652
Do you have
an e-mail address?

144
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,281
I may be wrong, but I just
thought you should know.

145
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,655
I think something
a little fishy is going on.

146
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,353
A little fishy?
Yeah.

147
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,727
I mean, I've been noticing them
all day, and I just think...

148
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,625
That little girl is a child!

149
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,101
I don't wanna see you sniffing
around her anymore this afternoon.

150
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,228
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

151
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,601
Boy, have you lost your mind? No.

152
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,640
'Cause I'll help you find it.
What you looking for?

153
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,970
Ain't nobody gonna
help you out there.

154
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,168
Jesus can come
through that door

155
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,233
and he's not
gonna help you

156
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,302
if you don't stop sniffing
after my child. Okay.

157
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,344
Stanley yelled at me today.

158
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,215
That was one of the most
frightening experiences of my life.

159
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,932
That was Greensleeves,
a traditional English ballad

160
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,935
about the beheaded
Anne Boleyn.

161
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,437
And now,
a very special treat.

162
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,440
A book my grom-mutter used
to read me when I was a kid.

163
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,569
This is a very special story.
It's called Struwwelpeterl

164
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,373
by Heinrich Hoffmann
from 1864.

165
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,283
"The great tall tailor
always comes

166
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,321
"to little girls
that suck their thumbs. "

167
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,152
Are you listening, Sasha?
Right?

168
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,215
"And ere they dream
what he's about,

169
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,727
"he takes his great
sharp scissors out

170
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,160
"and then cuts their thumbs
clean off. "

171
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,289
Dwight, Dwight...
There's a photo.

172
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,457
What the hell are
you reading to them?

173
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,898
These are cautionary tales
for kids.

174
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:29,992
My grom-mutter
used to read them...

175
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,229
Yeah, you know what?
No, no, no, no.

176
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,602
They... No. The kids don't
wanna hear some weirdo book

177
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,937
that your Nazi war criminal
grandmother gave you.

178
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,942
What's a Nazi?
What's a Nazi?

179
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,477
Nazi was a fascist movement... Don't...

180
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,638
From the 1930s in Germany...
Don't, don't talk about Nazis

181
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,909
in front of... You know what?
They're gonna have nightmares.

182
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,007
Why don't you
just shut it?

183
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,349
I was gonna teach the children
how to make cornhusk dolls.

184
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,857
Why don't you just leave, okay? Okay.

185
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,789
Bye, Mr. Poop. All right.
There goes Mr. Poop.

186
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,829
Now, who likes Dane Cook?

187
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,159
I do!
I do!

188
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,064
Children cannot lie. They are
innocent and they speak the truth.

189
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,466
And out of the mouths
of babes,

190
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,199
Michael Scott
is freaking cool.

191
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,713
You know, I never misbehaved
in front of my father

192
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,649
because he was
a very strict disciplinarian.

193
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,586
I can only hope my mate has
some of those same qualities.

194
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,925
This is where the magic
happens. Right over here.

195
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,363
Let me show you this.

196
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:37,459
See all these? You know
what that is? That's paper.

197
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,596
This is where paper
comes from. Any questions?

198
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,775
So, you cut the paper
and dye it and stuff?

199
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,911
No, we don't actually cut the
paper. That's a good question.

200
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,313
The paper is sent to us, cut and
dyed, from a paper manufacturer.

201
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:55,444
And then we sell it to a business
for more than we paid for it.

202
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,783
That's not fair.
No.

203
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,847
Yes, it is. Well...
No.

204
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,949
You need someone in the
middle to facilitate...

205
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,961
You're just a middleman.
I'm not just a middleman.

206
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,964
Wait. Why doesn't the sawmill just
sell the paper directly to people?

207
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,330
You are describing
Office Depot.

208
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,335
And they're kind of
running us out of business.

209
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,598
We have better service
than they do.

210
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,605
There's Creed!
Let's take a look

211
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,837
at what he's doing,
everybody.

212
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,712
This is Creed.

213
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,578
And he is in charge
of something.

214
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,674
Right?
That is correct.

215
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,685
Say hi to the kids.
Hi, kids.

216
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,248
Have you ever seen
a foot with four toes?

217
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,284
What are you doing? Stop it! Stop
it! Just... No, no, no, no, no!

218
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,622
Would you cut it out?

219
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,788
What is your problem? The
hair covers it up mostly.

220
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,923
No, no, no, we're not gonna
see the four-toed Creed, okay?

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,831
You know, there's something
interesting about me

222
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,736
that you might want to know. I
used to be the star of a kids' show.

223
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,740
No way! It's true. I did.

224
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,708
You serious?
I am totally serious.

225
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,268
There was a show called Fundle
Bundle and I was the star.

226
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,007
That doesn't sound
like a show. It's true.

227
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,777
I can prove it.
I can prove it. Watch this.

228
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,943
Ryan! Can you
come here a second?

229
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,388
I would like you to go to my
mother's house in Dickson City.

230
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,583
And if she is at the pool,

231
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,489
the back kitchen window
should be unlocked.

232
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,118
I want you to boost
yourself up. All right.

233
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,686
I want you to go down to the
basement. In the basement is a tape

234
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,958
labeled "Fundle Bundle. "

235
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,000
I want you to grab it. I
want you to get my guitar.

236
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,398
Right. Okay. I want
you to get a tambourine.

237
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,834
Do you know
how to play the tambourine?

238
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,894
I'm already getting the
pizzas from Brunetti's, so...

239
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,837
You know, I can go with him. No!

240
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,001
I will go.
Okay. Thank you, Ryan.

241
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,038
Good attitude.
Hottest in the office.

242
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,877
All right. Now, what kind
of pizza do you like?

243
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,780
I don't get why parents
are always complaining

244
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,046
about how tough it is
to raise kids.

245
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,579
You joke around with them,

246
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,884
you give them pizza,
you give them candy,

247
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,983
you let them live their lives.
They're adults, for God's sake.

248
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,393
I am going to give you
a little blast from the past

249
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,296
of Michael Gary Scott,
when he was a child star

250
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,696
and a show that you might
remember called Fundle Bundle.

251
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,931
Okay,
without further ado, Ryan.

252
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,030
Fundle, are you ready

253
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,506
Yeah!

254
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,803
Let's have some fun!

255
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,471
That is Miss Trudy. You
can't tell from the costume,

256
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,537
but she had
an amazing body.

257
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,715
Okay,
you can fast-forward.

258
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,878
And I want you...
Is that a real,

259
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,012
functioning windmill?
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop.

260
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,515
Yes! That is
Edward R. Meow.

261
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,619
That's pretty funny.
Yes.

262
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,666
Recess!
Hey, what's your name?

263
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,861
My name's Chet.
Well, hi, Chet.

264
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,598
Is that Chet Montgomery? I don't know.

265
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:30,438
That is! He's the
meteorologist from channel 5.

266
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,773
"Checking in with Chet.
Doppler 7."

267
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,074
That guy's legit.

268
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,947
What do you wanna be when
you grow up? I wanna be on TV.

269
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,577
And he is on TV now!

270
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,090
Would everybody please shut up?
Please. So you don't miss it.

271
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,557
Okay, next.

272
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,625
So, what's your name?
Oh, that's me! That's me!

273
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,932
What's your favorite subject in school?

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,561
Recess.

275
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,299
So, tell me, what do you
wanna be when you grow up?

276
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:06,144
I wanna be married and have a 100
kids so I can have 100 friends,

277
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,043
and no one can say no
to being my friend.

278
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,585
Okay. Well, nice talking with you,
Michael. Back to you, Miss Trudy.

279
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,985
Hi, everyone. It's one of my favorite...
I could have sworn there was...

280
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,690
Did you get married?
No.

281
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,297
Why not?
It just never happened.

282
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,468
So, do you have any kids?
Nope.

283
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,006
Do you have a girlfriend? I do okay.

284
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,507
Was Chet Montgomery cool back then? Yes.

285
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,043
Even I have a girlfriend.
Okay. All right. Okay.

286
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,807
So, you didn't get to be
what you wanted to be?

287
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,581
I guess not.

288
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,454
You know,
I have a load of work to do.

289
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:53,048
So, I am going to grab
a slice of this delish pizza

290
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,124
and I'm gonna go
do my work.

291
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,853
Bye.

292
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,771
He's not coming out.
He won't pick up the phone.

293
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,638
I can't believe his mom
dressed him like that.

294
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,407
That's the real tragedy.

295
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,846
Pam, Pam!
I love this guy!

296
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,211
Come on!

297
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,728
So, Melissa, I met your mom
a couple times.

298
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,288
She's so nice.

299
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,458
Who, Teri?

300
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,403
That woman is not my mother.
That is my stepmother.

301
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,704
Mr. Poop, I have
to tell you something.

302
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,304
Okay. But first,
that's not my name.

303
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,643
You're ugly.

304
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,881
Well, at least I'm not a
horrible little latchkey kid

305
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,048
who got suspended
from school.

306
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,784
So...

307
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,554
Meredith!

308
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,765
Yeah?

309
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,471
I think these
belong to you.

310
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,304
Oh, that's okay.
She can keep those.

311
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,646
Believe me,
she has enough toys.

312
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,078
She doesn't need
your watch.

313
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,152
Thank you.

314
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,016
Is everything okay?

315
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,320
You have to ask me that because
you work for Human Resources.

316
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,761
That's true.

317
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,268
You know, sure, playing the field
is great. Don't get me wrong.

318
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,239
But there's more to life
than notches on my bedpost.

319
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,135
Tell me something honestly.

320
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,011
Do you think that it is too
late for me to have kids?

321
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,545
Well, you need a wife first.
Or at least a girlfriend.

322
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,381
What about...
Not Jan.

323
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,442
Okay.

324
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:06,388
If you really wanna have kids,
I guess you could somehow...

325
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,256
A foster parent or something.

326
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,057
Or biologically.

327
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,196
Somehow.

328
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,504
Thanks. That's... No, that
really means a lot to me.

329
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,045
Hey, does Sasha have
a godfather? Because...

330
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,808
Yes.
Okay.

331
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,619
Is it okay if I take one?
Sure.

332
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,784
Thank you.
You're welcome.

333
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,087
Is your job hard?
It's not too bad.

334
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,755
I get to shred things
sometimes. Do you wanna see?

335
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,888
Yeah!

336
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,329
Really?
Yeah.

337
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,825
Okay.

338
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,505
Here it is. Don't put
your fingers in there.

339
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,336
Cool, huh?
That's so cool, yeah!

340
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,642
Yeah, I get to do this,
like, every week.

341
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,181
That's so awesome.
I know.

342
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,476
Yes, it is true.

343
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:10,852
I, Michael Scott, am signing up
with an online dating service.

344
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,016
Thousands of people have done
it. And I am going to do it.

345
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,460
I need a username.
And I have a great one.

346
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,461
Little Kid Lover.

347
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:28,336
That way people will know exactly
where my priorities are at.

348
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,573
Go ahead.

349
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,004
Do you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

350
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,311
Oh, man, I would love to.

351
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,250
I can't tonight. But can I
come over some other time?

352
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,118
What are you doing?
You never have plans.

353
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,816
Thanks, Kev.

354
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,088
I'm actually going on a date.
Nice.

355
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,390
Hey, no please.
You can't leave yet.

356
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,989
There's still one more
thing we need to do.

357
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,734
You who are
on the road

358
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,804
Must have a code

359
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,672
that you can live by

360
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:11,348
And so become yourself

361
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,319
Because the past

362
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,117
is just a good bye

363
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,891
And teach your children well

364
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,691
Why does he own a guitar if
he doesn't know how to play.

365
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,733
I think he thought his
ukulele skills would transfer.

366
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,362
And feed them
on your dreams

367
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,998
My theory is that...

368
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,168
The one they picks

369
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,743
the one you'll know by

370
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,251
Don't you ever ask them why

371
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,221
If I told you, you would cry

372
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,488
You just look at them and sigh

373
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,692
and know they love you

374
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,929
And they do. Your parents
love you very much.

375
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,265
One more time.

376
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,327
You...

377
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,773
The Schrutes consider
children very valuable.

378
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,779
In the olden days, the women
would bear many children,

379
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,179
so we would have enough
laborers to work the fields.

380
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,275
And if it was
an especially cold winter

381
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,912
and there weren't
enough grains or vegetables,

382
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,548
they would eat
the weakest of the brood.

383
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,423
No, they didn't eat
the children.

384
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,520
It never came to that.
