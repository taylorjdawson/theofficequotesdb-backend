00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,136
Can you confirm that the straps are tight?

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,599
Yes.

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:09,966
But this seems a little...

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,408
And now the chains.

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,210
A lot of people think that magic camp
is just for kids.

6
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:19,513
And that's why so many other people
in my class were kids.

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,713
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:27,927
It's really for anybody with a dream
and a belief in magic,

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,022
and a little extra time after school.

10
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,100
Magic, magic, magic.

11
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:41,671
And now, Michael the Magic will attempt
to escape from extreme bondage.

12
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,940
Can he do it? I don't see how he can.

13
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,171
I know how.

14
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,975
He'll dislocate his shoulder
and slip his arm out.

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,312
No. No.

16
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,977

Three...
Sorry. Sorry, quick thing.

18
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,946
So is it true that if you can't get out,
you don't want anyone to help you?

19
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,858
I will get out. Oh, yes. I will.

20
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,498
So we shouldn't help you no matter
how much you might beg and plead?

21
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,864
No. All right. Just... This is getting hot,
so let's just do this, okay?

Michael, you go to parties all the time.
Why is tonight so special?

43
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,627
Well, tonight is so special

44
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:57,972
because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO,
not his initials, common mistake,

45
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,536
is having a little shindig
for all the managers in the company.

46
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,015
And Jan and I are going
as a couple for the first time.

47
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,511
So it's kind of our coming out party, really.

48
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,189
And that is why tonight is so special.

49
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,815

50
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,621
Oh, no thanks.
I think Karen and I will take my car.

Yeah.

52

save some gas, have fun. Long trip.

I've decided
that I'm going to be more honest.

what I want directly.

Downside?

Of course I do. How are you, Michael?

193
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,689
Jan and I are lovers.

194

It feels so good to finally say that out loud.

David, can I speak to you privately
for just a moment, please?

00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,154
(EXCLAIMS)

355
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,494
Don't mention that you and I are dating

356
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,727
'cause I think
he might still have feelings for me.

357
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,064
Wallace?

358
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,572
What the hell?
Have you dated, like, every guy here?

359
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,844
(LAUGHING)

360
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,973
Wow.

361
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,480
Okay.

362
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,538
You got me.

363
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,083
I so got you.

364
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,413
So none of them?

365
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,578
Of course not.

366
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,285
I mean you're, kind of, like, my first.

367
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,654
Really?

368
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,160
Oh, my God, it's so easy...
Okay.

369
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,059
...it's not even fun.

370
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,290
Hey, Jan.

371
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,460
Not too good.

372
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,702
Did you get a chance
to try Michael's homemade potato salad?

373
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,107
<i>MICHAEL: Rachel thinks</i>
<i>that I brought homemade potato salad.</i>

374
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,476
But I just picked it up at the supermarket.
It's funny.

375
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:59,779
I wish I could make potato salad that good.
It's just potatoes and mayonnaise.

376
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,047
There's something wrong with Jan.

377
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,311
(GROANS)

378
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,651
What's...

379
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,185
What's with Jan and Michael?

380
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,919
I don't know... Where to begin.

381
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,555
(BOTH LAUGH)

382
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,631
(CLATTERING)

383
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,007
My ball.

384
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,638
The chimney's in decent shape. Not great.

385
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,545
I found some termite damage
in a crawl space

386
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,278
and some structural flaws in the foundation.

387
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,786
So, all in all,

388
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,556
it was a pretty fun cocktail party.

389
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,396
What?

390
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,657
I want us to make it.

391
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,698
I want a fresh start.

392
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,429
That's awesome. That's what I want.

393
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:56,402
Okay, but in order for us to make it,
there can't be any secrets between us.

394
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,534
I didn't... I didn't do anything.

395
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,272
Ask anybody.
I totally could have and I didn't at all.

396
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,779
Just listen.

397
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,012
Remember that casino night about a month
before we were supposed to get married?

398
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,111
I kissed Jim.

399
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,546
What?

400
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,387
He told me how he felt
and I guess I had feelings, too.

401
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,620
And we kissed.

402
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,683
Jim came on to you?

403
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,786
Just listen.

404
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,229
No, I am <i>listening!</i>
That's the problem, I'm <i>listening!</i>

405
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,323
Don't yell.

406
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,697
Don't yell?

407
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,566
This is over.

408
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,767
Yeah. You're right. This is so <i>over!</i>

409
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,676
Are you kidding me, Pam? Come <i>on!</i>

410
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,472
<i>God!</i>

411
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:37,840
(GLASS SHATTERING)

412
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,816
Stupid jet <i>skis!</i>

413
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,719
(YELLING)

414
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,118
Our first fight.

415
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,661
If this is about
what happened in the bathroom,

416
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,198
there was no place to cuddle...

417
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,733
I feel sick.

418
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,499
You didn't have any of the potato salad,
did you?

419
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,835
You know, we were good when we were
just running around, you know?

420
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,842
In secret. It was wrong and it was exciting,

421
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,977
and maybe it was a mistake to take it public.

422
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:17,946
Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady,
then you have hurt me greatly.

423
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,854
Michael...
Greatly.

424
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,184
Please don't cry.

425
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,454
I'm not going to cry.

426
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,326
I feel like it, but I am not going to.

427
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,763
Why don't you just take
your stupid love contract

428
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,027
and tear it up into a million pieces?

429
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,069
It was never a love contract, Michael.
Yeah.

430
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,728
And besides,
I have already given a copy to David.

431
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,772
It would be just as embarrassing
to get it back from him

432
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,705
as it was handing it to him...
I want the house, Jan.

433
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,367
I want the picket fence.

434
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:42,174
I want the ketchup fights
and the tickling and the giggling.

435
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,608
I didn't mean it, okay? I was...

436
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,710
Whatever.

437
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:53,486
I was tired. I'm tired and I didn't eat enough.
And that's all. That was it.

438
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,550
That's it. You didn't mean it.
That's all. No, I didn't.

439
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,889
So...
That's all.

440
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,896
I'm just saying I didn't mean it.

441
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,090
Okay. Fine.

442
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,628
I love you, Jan.

443
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,761
Okay.

444
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,801
Don't break up, you guys.

445
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,448
You're great together.

446
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,659
Are they gonna call the cops?

447
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,059
No. I paid them off.

448
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,059
Jet ski money?

449
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,191
All of it.

450
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,396
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
