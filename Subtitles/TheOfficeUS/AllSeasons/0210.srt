1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,468
Go. Get the door.
Here we are.

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:05,765
Go. Push.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,329
Oh, God.
Push.

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,999
No, no, no. Turn it
around. Really shove it.

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,736
You'll break it. Shove
it through. Break it!

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,937
You shove it.
Shove it back.

7
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,015
Here we go.

8
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,952
Don't break the
branches, Dwight.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,951
All right.

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,582
I got a splinter. Well, suck
it up. We all have problems.

11
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,252
Hey, everybody.
Look what we have.

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,362
Nice, huh?

13
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,660
I've got it leveraged.

14
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,098
Push. Straight up.
On three. Ready?

15
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,568
Big. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,532
Merry Christmas.

17
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,371
Did it work?

18
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,416
Well, sort of.

19
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,812
Why did you
get it so big?

20
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:31,255
A, that's what she said, and,
B, I wanted it to be impressive.

21
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,293
The biggest day of the year deserves
the biggest tree of the year.

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,624
But what are we gonna do
with this hacked-off part?

23
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,722
Well, that is a perfectly
good mini-tree, Kevin,

24
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,529
and we are going to
sell that to charity.

25
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,093
That's what Christmas
is all about.

26
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,979
So this year, for the first time
ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa,

27
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,915
and I got her this teapot,

28
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,920
which I know she really wants,
so she can make tea at her desk.

29
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,253
But I'm also gonna stuff it
with some inside jokes.

30
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,590
Like, this is my
high school yearbook photo.

31
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,119
She saw it at the party,
and it really makes her laugh.

32
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,922
Not sure why.

33
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,032
What else?

34
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,494
This is a hot sauce packet.

35
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,301
She put this on a hot dog
a couple years ago

36
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,899
because she thought
it was ketchup.

37
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,573
And it was really funny,
so I kept the other two.

38
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:32,009
This would take a little too
long to explain, so I won't.

39
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,882
And this is the card.

40
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,717
Because Christmas is the time
to tell people how you feel.

41
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,291
Is there anything
we're missing?

42
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,625
Phyllis, you got the lights?

43
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,631
Yes, I got
those cute little ones.

44
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,134
Do you think I should
have gotten the big ones?

45
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,534
We'll see.

46
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,897
Angela drafted me into the
party planning committee.

47
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:59,240
Her memo said that we need to
prepare for every possible disaster,

48
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,480
which to me seems excessive.

49
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,954
Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho, ho, pimp.

50
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,121
I'm kidding. What do we got?
What do we got?

51
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,955
How many plates are we getting? Fifty.

52
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,723
Double it. Double everything.
Double ice cream. Double napkins.

53
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,559
Double it. On me.

54
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,363
It was a tough year. I had
to fire somebody this year.

55
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,562
This party has to really rock.

56
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,368
Check it out.
Christmas bonus, 3,000 Gs.

57
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,433
I got this for helping
save the company money.

58
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,472
So I guess some good came
out of firing Devon after all.

59
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,774
Maybe I should call him
and tell him that.

60
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,480
I want people to cut loose. I
want people making out in closets.

61
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,823
I want people hanging from the
ceilings, lamp shades on the heads.

62
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,795
I want it to be
a Playboy Mansion party.

63
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:55,095
And also, I want you to know and spread
the word that I will have my digital camera.

64
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,762
And I'll be taking pictures
all along the way.

65
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,169
And the best and
craziest thing that happens

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,970
will be on the cover
of the newsletter. Incentive.

67
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,306
You do realize that we can't
serve liquor at the party.

68
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,243
Yeah. I know. Damn it.

69
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,281
Stupid corporate wet blankets.
Like booze ever killed anybody.

70
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,045
One. Two. Three.

71
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,356
You guys should
use a hand truck.

72
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,086
Do we have one?
No.

73
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,527
Will you help me?

74
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,269
No! No way. It... No.
Come on, Mike.

75
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,167
Let me borrow the hat
for just a couple of hours.

76
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,569
You wanna be Santa?
Yeah.

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,005
Have you ever seen Santa?

78
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,541
Yeah, I've seen Santa.
Okay.

79
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,544
Who cares? Well, I'm
sorry. It just doesn't work.

80
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,206
Michael, I would like
to be the elf.

81
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,015
That makes sense because
he has elfish features.

82
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,151
Okay, everyone.
Listen up.

83
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,323
It is time to get your
presents, wrap them

84
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:57,352
and place them
under the tree, like so.

85
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,692
If you do not get your present
wrapped and under the tree

86
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,032
within the next five minutes,

87
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,231
you will be disqualified
from Secret Santa. All right?

88
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,502
No exceptions except Michael.

89
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,543
I got Angela.

90
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:16,505
She is into these posters
of babies dressed as adults.

91
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,607
I got her one of those.

92
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,652
I felt kind of weird
buying that.

93
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,557
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth,
I don't know anything about Creed.

94
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,594
I know his name's Creed. I
know he works right over there.

95
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,788
I think he's Irish and I...

96
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,256
I got him this
shamrock keychain.

97
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,098
I got myself for Secret Santa.

98
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,763
I was supposed to tell
somebody, but I didn't.

99
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,669
You get something
good this year?

100
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,546
I think I did a pretty good
job. Yeah? Who did you have?

101
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,674
Well, I can't tell you,
'cause it's a secret.

102
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,616
I think I got something
pretty nice for my guy.

103
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,712
Yeah? I spent a lot of
dough. Lot of dough. Wow.

104
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,087
Well, there's a $20
limit, right? So... Yeah.

105
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,252
I wanted this party to be really special
so I sort of went above and beyond.

106
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,387
That's great. Well, don't tell
me who it is, 'cause I can...

107
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,423
It was Ryan. Yeah.
I have Ryan.

108
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,767
Gather round. Secret Santa,
let's go. Let's go. Come on.

109
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,133
Stanley, no. I'm gonna handle
the cord. Okay, safety reasons.

110
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,676
I know how
to plug something in.

111
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,109
I want to do it.

112
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,842
All right, let's count it
down, like Rockefeller Center.

113
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,110
Ready?

114
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,814
Three, two, one.
Three, two, one.

115
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,448
Not great.

116
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,187
I'm sorry, everybody.

117
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,858
I think the tree looks nice.

118
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,898
Hey, I could get
some flares from my car.

119
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,561
No. No. Shake it off, everybody.
Just, let's do Secret Santa.

120
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,501
Presents are the best way to
show someone how much you care.

121
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,267
It is like this tangible thing
that you can point to and say,

122
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,643
"Hey, man, I love you
this many dollars' worth. "

123
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,945
First present, Oscar.

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,280
Shower radio. Neat.

125
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,583
Oh, good, that was from me.

126
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,487
Thanks, Kelly. You know
I was gonna get one of...

127
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,391
Okay. Okay. That's enough.
Let's keep it moving on.

128
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,622
Jim.
Oh, cool.

129
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:15,956
That's from me.

130
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,059
Great.

131
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,638
Where did you get it?

132
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,696
I don't know.
It was so long ago.

133
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,140
He obviously forgot
to get me something,

134
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,407
and then he went into his closet
and dug out this little number

135
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,970
and then threw it in a bag.

136
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,981
Yep. That's exactly
what happened.

137
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,244
Pam.

138
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,616
Oh, my God!

139
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,189
Thank you very much, Santa,
whoever you are.

140
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,064
It's awesome.
There's a little more to it.

141
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,500
All right. Next.

142
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,299
Ryan.
No. Don't.

143
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,371
Whoa, a video iPod.

144
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,572
Whoa. Wow. Jeez.

145
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,540
Somebody really got carried away
with the spirit of Christmas.

146
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,813
That was me. I got carried
away with the spirit.

147
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,481
Wasn't there a
$20 limit on the gift?

148
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,985
This is 400 bucks.

149
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,524
You don't know that.

150
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,754
Yeah, you left
the price tag on.

151
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,852
I did?
Yeah.

152
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,624
What? Oh, shoot. Wow.

153
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,599
Okay, well, who cares? It
doesn't matter what I spent.

154
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,659
What matters is that
Christmas is fun, right?

155
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,197
Michael.
Oh, hey, for me.

156
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,943
What is in here?

157
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,348
Oh, come on.

158
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,848
I knitted it for you.

159
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,208
An oven mitt?

160
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,146
Okay.

161
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,414
So Phyllis is
basically saying,

162
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,982
"Hey, Michael, I know you did a
lot to help the office this year

163
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,621
"but I only care about you
a homemade oven mitt's worth. "

164
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,460
I gave Ryan an iPod.

165
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,369
Should we just keep
opening up the presents?

166
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,432
We don't do anything until Michael
gives us further instructions.

167
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,240
I got it.

168
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,476
We are going to turn

169
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,816
Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.

170
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,487
What is Yankee Swap?

171
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,956
One person chooses a gift.

172
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,928
The next person can either choose
a gift or steal that person's gift.

173
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,925
If your gift gets stolen, then
you can steal someone else's gift

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,399
or choose a new gift.

175
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,197
I thought that was
called Nasty Christmas.

176
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,897
Yeah, we call it
White Elephant.

177
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,667
Well, I call it fun!

178
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,968
Why are we doing this?

179
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,976
Because it's better.
Because it's more special.

180
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,511
It sounds mean.
Shut it.

181
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,206
No, it's not...

182
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,611
Okay, just give it a shot.

183
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,617
Michael should have asked the
party planning committee first.

184
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:49,746
He's not supposed to just spring
things on us out of nowhere.

185
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,021
Okay, Meredith is up first.
Here's the deal.

186
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,927
You can either pick a new gift

187
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,297
or you can steal
somebody else's gift

188
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,598
that they've already gotten,
like the oven mitt.

189
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,468
I'll take the teapot.

190
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,302
Oh. Shouldn't we...

191
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,971
I bought that specifically
for Pam. Yankee Swap!

192
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,409
That's what makes it fun.

193
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,346
Pam, you can steal the oven
mitt now. I'll take the iPod.

194
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,679
And I have to give it to her?
I don't have a choice?

195
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,912
Yes. Now, you can
steal the oven mitt,

196
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,354
the old shirt or the shower
radio or pick a new gift.

197
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,935
That was meant for Kelly.
Yeah, I figured.

198
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,103
I think this is going great.

199
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,781
Yikes.

200
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,216
Well, it's for Angela, so...

201
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,560
That's, like, the creepiest
thing that I've ever seen.

202
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,291
Angela, you're up.

203
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,199
I'll take the poster.

204
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,806
Some people like these.

205
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,000
I will steal the iPod.

206
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,206
Everyone wants the iPod.

207
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,908
It's a huge hit. It is
almost a Christmas miracle.

208
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:29,644
Oh, well, Oscar, you little
gourmand, you have the next turn.

209
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,954
I'll take the teapot.
Damn it.

210
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,088
Okay. Moving along,
Meredith, let's go.

211
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,663
I really want the iPod.

212
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,332
It's already been stolen this
round. Pick something else.

213
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,427
I hope nobody takes this baby,
'cause this is great.

214
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,132
Wow, look at that
fine craftsmanship.

215
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,875
Somebody really put a lot of
work into that. It's beautiful.

216
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,913
I'll take the oven mitt.

217
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,840
Sucker!

218
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,813
See, I wanted somebody to take
it. Boom! Reverse psychology.

219
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,482
Reverse psychology
is an awesome tool.

220
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,790
I don't know if you guys
know about it,

221
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,559
but basically you make someone think
the opposite of what you believe

222
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,131
and that tricks them
into doing something stupid.

223
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,897
Works like a charm.

224
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,439
"In addition to these
paint ball pellets,

225
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,004
"your gift includes two paint
ball lessons with Dwight Shrute. "

226
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,414
You and me, Michael. Yes.

227
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,521
Who wants to take paint ball lessons?
How is that better than an iPod?

228
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,323
I never said it was
better than an iPod.

229
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,264
Michael keeps bragging about
his iPod, but you know what?

230
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,895
Two paint ball lessons with
someone as experienced as I am

231
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,201
is worth easily,
like, 2 grand.

232
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,435
Take that, Saddam.

233
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,167
Last gift, Kevin.

234
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,836
I want the foot bath.

235
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,012
That's the thing
I bought myself.

236
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,514
I'm really psyched to use it.

237
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,446
Maybe I should have
taken the iPod.

238
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,053
Oh, shoot.

239
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,659
Pam, steal something
or pick the final gift.

240
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,064
I want the iPod.
Damn it.

241
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,329
Sure you don't want
the teapot?

242
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,270
Well, I mean, it's
an iPod. But... Right.

243
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,705
Sorry, I...
No. No. Definitely. It's...

244
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:34,508
Okay, well, I guess I will
take that book of short stories.

245
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,941
Yes! There you go.
I want the tea pot. Gracias.

246
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,311
Got to be kidding me.

247
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,920
Yankee Swap is like
Machiavelli meets

248
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,586
Christmas.

249
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,727
What is she so upset about?

250
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,732
Maybe because you hated
her present so much.

251
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,030
Come on! I think that
Yankee Swap was a big hit.

252
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,535
I think it was a success,

253
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,266
and I'm the one who ended up with
Dwight's stupid paint ball pellets.

254
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,707
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that
we all bought gifts for specific people.

255
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,439
And you should have just bought
a $20 gift like everyone else.

256
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,639
Well, I didn't.

257
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,274
I got a big bonus
because I fired Devon,

258
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,751
and I used the money to buy
something awesome. Sue me!

259
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,952
You got a bonus check?

260
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,352
How much?

261
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:24,126
It wasn't... It wasn't
that much. It was $3,000.

262
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,187
All right, I'm done now.

263
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,795
Unbelievable.

264
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,498
I do the nicest thing that anyone
has ever done for these people,

265
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,698
and they freak out.

266
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,334
Well, happy birthday, Jesus.
Sorry your party's so lame.

267
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,715
It comes to $166.41.

268
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:48,116
All right, now, you're the expert. Is
this enough to get 20 people plastered?

269
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,147
Fifteen bottles of vodka?

270
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,953
Yeah, that should do it.
Cool, cool. Box it up.

271
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,204
I bought this teapot for Pam,
and I know she really wants it.

272
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,105
So, can I trade you for it?
No trades.

273
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,110
Come on. It's a shamrock
keychain. Good luck.

274
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,973
"A real man makes his own
luck. " Billy Zane, Titanic.

275
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,416
Look it has sentimental value,
Dwight. Can I buy it from you?

276
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,454
No. I want it.
I'm going to use it.

277
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,148
You don't even drink tea.
True.

278
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,386
But I get sinus infections, and
sinus infections can be cured

279
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,427
by making your tea
from green tea leaf stems...

280
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,792
Okay.
... and pouring it directly

281
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,421
into your nose, like so.

282
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,259
To think that my gift to Pam
will be used for that,

283
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,367
it's a little
too much to handle.

284
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,635
This is awesome.

285
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,269
I know. It's totally gonna
change the way I work out.

286
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,872
Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these
for Christmas, now I don't have to.

287
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,109
I'm gonna save a ton of money.

288
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,514
So what are you
gonna get me instead?

289
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,212
I don't know. Probably, like,
a sweater or something.

290
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,513
Uh-oh.

291
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,753
Looks like Santa
was a little naughty.

292
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,696
What is that?

293
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,757
This is Christmas spirit,
as in spirits, booze.

294
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,535
We can drink?

295
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,696
We're really not supposed
to serve alcohol.

296
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:17,037
Zip it, Toby! Just...
I mean, it's a party. Come on.

297
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:21,136
If I can't throw a good party for my
employees, then I am a terrible boss.

298
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,881
Who wants a drink?
Me. Please.

299
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,507
Go! Here we go!

300
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,077
The deal is that
this is my last hurrah,

301
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,588
'cause I made a
New Year's resolution

302
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,956
that I'm not gonna drink
anymore during the week.

303
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,986
Hi, guys.
Hey.

304
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,656
Does everyone know
my boyfriend, Bob Vance?

305
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,792
Kevin Malone. Bob Vance,
Vance Refrigeration.

306
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,769
Stanley Hudson. Bob
Vance, Vance Refrigeration.

307
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,739
Ryan Howard. Bob Vance,
Vance Refrigeration.

308
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,639
What line of work you in, Bob?

309
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,173
I think after I lost Culpepper
and T.O. It was over, man.

310
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,045
Oh, yeah,
I need McMahon,

311
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,642
Deion Branch to have big
games, or else I'm done.

312
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,777
It's possible.

313
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,788
I can't believe you
traded Shaun Alexander, man.

314
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,084
I had to,
I needed defense.

315
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,556
Come on! Shaun Alexander?

316
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,889
He's the best back in
the league. It's defense.

317
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,623
Oh, no. That's not
worth it. It is worth it.

318
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,858
Never. Are you kidding? You wait.

319
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:18,130
Anybody making out in here?
Not yet. Give it time.

320
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,529
Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink.

321
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,403
Okay, how's it going in here?

322
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,840
We're running low on cups. Do you
want me to just run out and get some?

323
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,036
Yeah, there should be some...
No, no, no.

324
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,703
We'll find some.
Don't leave the party.

325
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,214
One, two, three!

326
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,585
Kudos to Ryan,
king of the party committee.

327
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,850
Oh, no.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

328
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,289
I really did not do anything.

329
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,520
Oh, no, no.
No false modesty, my friend.

330
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,560
You know, you don't have to
answer calls during a party.

331
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,159
Just thought you should know.

332
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,137
No, I was just
checking out my present.

333
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,905
But...
I traded with Dwight.

334
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,174
Just, I figured, you know,

335
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,681
you went to a lot of trouble
and it means a lot.

336
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,119
And also, Roy got me an iPod

337
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,489
or was going to
get me an iPod, so...

338
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,485
Well, either way.

339
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:19,063
This is an amazing gift because
it comes with bonus gifts.

340
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,531
Look inside.

341
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,875
Oh, my God!
The yearbook picture.

342
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,704
Yeah, I think
I made the right choice.

343
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,078
Oh, my God! It's incredible.

344
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,378
Is this the bottle timer?

345
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,442
I didn't think you were gonna
get that one. I really didn't.

346
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,451
This is so awesome.

347
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,253
Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan,
you are the guy I'd want it to go to.

348
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,522
Thank you.
You're welcome.

349
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,962
Merry Christmas, asswipe.
No way.

350
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,262
Oh, you're kidding me. Packer!

351
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,101
Yes! Todd Packer,
ladies and gentlemen.

352
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,799
What's up, my nerds?
Check it out!

353
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,278
Oh, no, no. Oh, look at that.
Icing on the cake.

354
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,508
Pacman need a drinky.
Oh, let's fix you up.

355
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,517
Who wants to fix up... Toby?
Toby's gonna fix you up.

356
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,445
Yeah.

357
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,359
Darryl. There you go.

358
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,054
You earned it.
That's okay, Mike.

359
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,292
No, no, no, no. I really,
really want you to have it.

360
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,231
All right. Thanks, man.

361
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,098
Hey, Merry Christmas.

362
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,033
Whose butt is that?
Mine.

363
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,372
Oh, how did I not guess that?

364
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:42,504
Lampshade on head!
It's happening!

365
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,609
Oh, no.

366
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,422
Hey.
Oh, hello there.

367
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,166
But what are you doing?
I don't know.

368
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,764
You shouldn't do things like that.
The man is supposed to do that.

369
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,050
Thanks for the party, Michael.
Yeah.

370
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,348
Oh, hey... Listen up. We're
going to Poor Richard's.

371
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,547
Who's in?
I'm in.

372
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,748
Yes.

373
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,984
Michael?
Poor Richard's?

374
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,785
Yeah. That sounds good.

375
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,692
Christmas is awesome.

376
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:36,063
First of all, you get to spend
time with people you love.

377
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,831
Secondly, you can get drunk
and no one can say anything.

378
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,636
Third, you give presents. What's
better than giving presents?

379
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,668
And fourth, getting presents. So,
four things. Not bad for one day.

380
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,874
It's really the
greatest day of all time.

381
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,779
Hey, Meredith.

382
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,912
Heading over to Poor Richard's? Yep.

383
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,220
Cool, cool, cool.
Do you need a ride?

384
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,260
All right, let's head out.

385
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,973
Sounds good. Do you have a coat? Yeah.

386
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,338
Okay!
