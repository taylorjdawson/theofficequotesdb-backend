00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,125
Hello, Son.

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,763
If you're watching this,
that means I'm already dead.

3
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,007
Life is a...
How do you know
it's gonna be a boy?

4
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,805
How... Would you stop
interrupting, please?

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,204
Yesterday,
I was scraping some gunk

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,373
off my wall sockets
with a metal fork

7
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,612
and I gave myself
the nastiest shock.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,550
And when I came to,
I had an epiphery.

9
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,420
Life is precious.

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:33,732
And if I die,
I want my son

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,297
to know the dealio.
The dealio of life.

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,836
Here are some things
that I want to teach you

13
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,603
that your mother
won't be able to.

14
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,804
To jump-start a car,
first, pop the hood.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,614
Then you take these
bad boys and clip them
anywhere on the engine.

16
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:57,349
Then, you take these
and clip them wherever.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,995
Number eight,
learn how to take
off a woman's bra.

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,394
What...
We will demonstrate on Pam.

19
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,590
No.
And...

20
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,859
No.
Come on.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,934
You just twist your hand
until something breaks.

22
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,132
<i>Ow!</i>

23
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,801
Well, you get the picture.
Thanks, Pam.

24
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,173
And remember, no matter what,
I will always love you.

25
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,942
What if he's a murderer?

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,812
He's not gonna be a murderer.

27
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,044
Maybe that's how you die?

28
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,452
You know what, Dwight,
do you want to do this or no?

29
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,623
I wanna do this.
Okay.

30
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,149
From the top. Ready? Three...

31
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,455
Action.

32
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,310
Hello, everyone.

33
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:02,878
As you know,
we are six days away
from Phyllis' wedding.

34
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,221
So get your suits
to the dry cleaners
and get your hair did.

35
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,659
And Karen,
you might wanna invest

36
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,630
in a dress or
a skirt of some kind

37
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,360
if you don't
already have one.

38
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,096
This may be
Phyllis' only wedding ever.

39
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,139
It's my job to insure
that none of you
look like ragamuffins.

40
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:25,075
So I am
instituting <i>prima nocta.</i>

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,447
<i>Prima nocta,</i> I believe,
from the movie <i>Braveheart</i>

42
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,508
and confirmed on Wikipedia,

43
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,019
is when the king
got to deflower

44
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,589
every new bride on
her wedding night.

45
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,886
So...

46
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,795
I'm sorry,
I had a very
different understanding

47
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,765
as to what <i>prima nocta</i> meant.

48
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,695
I'm trying to
get everyone excited
about Phyllis' wedding

49
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,467
because I want her to get
people excited about
my wedding

50
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,907
when the time comes,
which won't be hard,

51
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,466
because it's
gonna be awesome.

52
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,103
A lot better than hers,
that's for sure.

53
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,772
It'll probably be on a boat.

54
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,009
What's up, spinsters?

55
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,107
Nothing.

56
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,909
You know,
this is a luncheon shower.

57
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,112
Girls only.

58
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,348
No problem.

59
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,452
The guys are having a little
shindig of their own

60
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,221
in the warehouse
from 2:30 to 3:15.

61
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,695
It is the only time
that Bob was available.

62
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,164
Sort of a guys' night out.

63
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,895
A G.N.O. If you will.
A gno.

64
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,934
Actually, it's more
of a guys' afternoon in.

65
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,496
A G.A.I. A gay.

66
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:33,608
Not... Not...
It's not gay.
It's just a...

67
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,307
It's a bridal shower for guys.
A guy shower.

68
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,682
An hour-Iong
shower with guys.

00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,288
Yes?

176
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,888
<i>JIM: Are you okay?</i>

177
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,660
I'm in...
I'm in the sex shop.

178
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,928
<i>Got you.</i>

179
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,735
<i>Okay, so they</i>
<i>have Albert Einstein,</i>

180
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,533
<i>Ben Franklin or</i>
<i>SpongeBob SquarePants.</i>

181
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,096
SquarePants?

182
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,573
<i>Yep, SpongeBob SquarePants.</i>

183
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,774
And you think
that'd be sexy?

184
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,276
Michael referred me
to a male strip club
called Banana Slings.

185
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,909
Instead,
I called the Scholastic
Speakers of Pennsylvania.

186
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,718
FRANKLIN:
Hold the door, <i>please!</i>

187
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,724
Thank you.

188
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,316
Hello.
Hello.

189
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,259
You wearing a thong?

190
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,322
What?

191
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,161
Sparkling cider is very good.

192
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,469
I think that's champagne.

193
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,535
MICHAEL: Hello, ladies.

194
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,872
Who, here, is a history buff?

195
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,104
I.

196
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,510
Who's a fan of buff naked?

197
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,407
Without further ado,

198
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:51,252
the one,
the only, the sexy,
Mr. Benjamin <i>Franklin!</i>

199
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,719
Thank you for that
introduction, Mr. <i>Scott!</i>

200
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:59,959
And good afternoon,
fine gentlewomen
of Dunder Mifflin.

201
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,629
Half pants, right,
Mr. Franklin?

202
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:04,931
Knickers, in fact. Yes.

203
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,972
He's in his knickers.

204
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,475
Mr. Franklin,
I would say you are probably

205
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,841
one of the sexiest
presidents ever.

206
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,972
Well, actually,
I never was President.

207
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,074
Yes, but Ben Franklin was.

208
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,955
I'm here to teach you
a little bit about my life

209
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,493
and the era of
the Founding Fathers...

210
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,550
(CLEARING THROAT)

211
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,157
And when they came
over on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

212
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,669
Wait.
This is the entertainment?

213
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,571
Yeah, all right, so,
I want you to give him

214
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,199
your undivided attention.

215
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,802
And Mr. Franklin.
If any of these
ladies misbehave,

216
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,439
I give you
permission to spank them,

217
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,914
especially that one.

218
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,116
Have you ever
seen a stripper before?

219
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,315
Yes.

220
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,119
Jennifer Garner
portrayed one on <i>Alias.</i>

221
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,286
It was one of
her many aliases.

222
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,488
Yeah, me neither.

223
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,587
Hey.
Hi.

224
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,463
I'm Elizabeth.
I'm the dancer
that was requested.

225
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,466
Okay.

226
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,104
I specifically
ordered a stripper.

227
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,935
I'm the stripper.

228
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,304
Oh, okay. Good.

229
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,933
Well, in the future, please
identify yourself as such.

230
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,638
Oh, God.
Okay.

231
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,280
"Is she hot?"

232
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,917
Text back, "Kind of."

233
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:35,018
It was a warm
June evening in 1 752,

234
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,392
the night of my
fateful kite flight...

235
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,691
Mr. Franklin?
Yes.

236
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,026
Do you have a girlfriend?

237
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,431
I have a lovely wife,
Deborah.

238
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,129
But don't you also
have girlfriends in Paris?

239
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,795
Like, a lot of them?

240
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,274
Well, that is
a gray area of my life.

241
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,870
Okay? So it was
a warm June evening...

242
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,948
Look at that.

243
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,984
Nothing like grilling
in the great outdoors.

244
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,248
Is it the same grill
you grilled your foot on?

245
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,312
No.

246
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,721
Yes, but I got
all the foot off of it.

247
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,885
Oh, gross.

248
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,924
Okay, Ben Franklin.

249
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,399
Ben Franklin tied
a cherry stem in his <i>mouth!</i>

250
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,563
Well, that is because
I am a Renaissance man.

251
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:23,870
Ben Franklin?
Do you wear boxers,
briefs or pantaloons?

252
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,308
Well, you're very saucy.

253
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,952
<i>Guys!</i> Beef,
it's what's for dinner.

254
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,621
Who wants some man meat?

255
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,249
I <i>do!</i> I want some man <i>meat!</i>

256
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,987
Michael, Dwight
would like your man meat.

257
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,791
Well, then,
my man meat he shall have.

258
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,121
There you go.

259
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,424
Deliciosity.

260
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,594
Of course.

261
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,795
Here we go.

262
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,504
So I guess, you have
the Ben Franklin
wig and the costume

263
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,941
and you figure,
"How can I put this
to practical use?"

264
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,535
Well, I'd like to
think that his dad

265
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,274
was a Ben Franklin
impersonator,

266
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,142
and he really
pressured him into it.

267
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,347
Hey, I wanted to talk to you.

268
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,049
I know this is
weird or whatever,

269
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,853
but Jim told me
about you guys.

270
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,295
What do you mean?

271
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,955
Well, that you kissed.

272
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,195
And we talked it through
and it's totally fine.

273
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,793
It's not a big deal,
it's just a kiss.

274
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,969
But you're not
still interested in him?

275
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,506
Oh, yeah.

276
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,873
Really?

277
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,945
Oh, <i>no!</i> I was
confused by your phrasing.

278
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,147
You should definitely
go out with Jim.

279
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,083
I mean,
you're going out with Jim.

280
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,644
I'm not going out with Jim.

281
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,815
You're dating him,
which is awesome,

282
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,051
because you guys
are great together.

283
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,320
Okay.

284
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,953
And I'm not into Jim.

285
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,724
Yeah.

286
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,590
So, well, good.

287
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,067
Yeah.

288
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,698
Sorry.

289
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,030
What are you sorry about?

290
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,210
What?

291
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,006
What are you sorry about?

292
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,682
Nothing.
I was just thinking
of something else.

293
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,682
Okay,
the game is No-Limit
Deuce-To-Seven Lowball.

294
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,187
Blinds 25l50.
Nickels are worth 10,

295
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,225
dimes, 25, and quarters, 50.
Nothing wild.

296
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,159
I call <i>shuffle!</i> Here we go.

297
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,965
Michael...

298
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,065
Gentlemen,
the entertainment is here.

299
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,973
Everybody, I'd like to
introduce you to Elizabeth.

300
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,237
Hi, guys.

301
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,471
That's a nice outfit.

302
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,276
I hear there's
an important meeting here.

303
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,180
I'm not really
into strippers.

304
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,147
You know what I find sexy?
Pam's art.

305
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,690
She's an artist
and I appreciate that.

306
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,063
It's very moving
and sexy, the art.

307
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,761
Hit <i>it!</i>

308
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,969
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

309
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,170
So where's the groom?

310
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,004
Oh, he's right there.

311
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,236
There he is.

312
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,403
Absolutely not.

313
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,777
That's all you,
that's all you.

314
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,177
<i>Okay!</i> All right, I'll do it.

315
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,414
Yeah, let's do <i>it!</i>
Let's do this thing.

316
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:23,977
Yeah? What do I...

317
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,023
Just sit on down.

318
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,853
All right.
All right.

319
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,291
Okay.
Here we go.

320
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,486
Oh, here we go. All <i>right!</i>

321
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,619
<i>Yes!</i>

322
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,027
(WHOOPING)

323
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,928
Not <i>bad!</i> Not <i>bad!</i>

324
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,391
You smell nice, like Tide.

325
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,094
What's that?

326
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,062
You smell like
Tide detergent.

327
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,365
Do you use Tide detergent?

328
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,273
I have a girlfriend, so...

329
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,043
I bet she'd be <i>jealous!</i>

330
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,246
Yeah, she probably...
Yeah, she would be.

331
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,812
You know what?
Okay. Excuse me.

332
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,915
This is sick, please.
Stop it, stop it.

333
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,323
Turn off the music,
because this is wrong.

334
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,190
This is <i>wrong!</i> This is wrong.

335
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,925
I have a girlfriend. I...

336
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,057
And you are engaged

337
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:14,037
and I'm sure you have
a boyfriend in prison
or something, so...

338
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,041
Let's just clear out, okay?
Shame on you.

339
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,440
Go back to <i>work!</i>

340
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,651
Elizabeth,
I want you to sit here.

341
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,550
When the phone rings,
answer it.

342
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,817
You want me to answer phones
with my clothes on?

343
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,059
We hired you for
three hours' work,
and we're gonna get it.

344
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,962
I love your poster.

345
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,001
Thank you.

346
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,578
You know,
I invented electricity.

347
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,810
I know.

348
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,082
Well, I'm sensing a little
electricity right here.

349
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,757
Didn't Ben Franklin
have syphilis?

350
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,625
Yes, but I don't.

351
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,325
My name is Gordon.

352
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,231
On one hand,
I want to be honest with
Jan and tell her the truth.

353
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,499
On the other hand,
I'm afraid she's gonna
dump me.

354
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,372
You know,
Michael, I fathered
an illegitimate son.

355
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,535
Really?

356
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,977
But I kept all this
from my wife, Deborah.

357
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,914
These things only serve
to upset the women.

358
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,474
They are the gentler sex.

359
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,876
Wow.

360
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,617
Ben Franklin,
you're really
kind of a sleazebag.

361
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,424
Stripper?

362
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,862
Could I ask you
a question about women?

363
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,869
Should I tell my girlfriend
that you danced up on me?

364
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,609
"Secrets, secrets are no fun.

365
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,671
"Secrets,
secrets hurt someone."

366
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,506
Wow.

367
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,751
Thank you.

368
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,122
Care for
a piece of chocolate?

369
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,923
Chocolate?
Where did you acquire it?

370
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,622
That is a delicacy
in the Amazon,

371
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,133
but it has not
yet been imported
to the United States.

372
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,930
Who is the king of Austria?
Joseph II.

373
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,731
Who is the king of Prussia?
Friedrich Wilhelm III.

374
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,101
Who is the king of England?

375
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,640
Why, the tyrant,
King George, of <i>course!</i>

376
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,440
I don't care what Jim says.

377
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,910
That is not
the real Ben Franklin.

378
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,209
I am <i>99%</i> sure.

379
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,878
<i>JAN: Michael, I left</i>
<i>a meeting. What is so urgent?</i>

380
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,217
<i>Are you... Are you okay?</i>

381
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,721
Not really.

382
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,027
Look, I don't know
how to say this,
so I just will.

383
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,118
<i>Okay.</i>

384
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:54,825
I went to a bachelor party

385
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,062
and things got
a little out of hand.

386
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,367
<i>When...</i>
<i>When did...</i>
<i>When, last night?</i>

387
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,572
No, today at work.

388
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,804
<i>You went to</i>
<i>a bachelor party at work?</i>

389
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,074
Yes, I kind of arranged it.

390
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,245
Well, I don't even think
the stripper was that hot.

391
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,079
Did you guys
think she was hot?

392
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,278
Kelly, don't do this.

393
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,445
Do what?
I just asked you a question.

394
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,284
You know
what you're doing.

395
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:21,315
Anyway, you know who
was totally flirting
with Ben Franklin? Pam.

396
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,328
Really? Looks like
I hired the right guy.

397
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,297
I'm glad. Any real
potential there, Beesly?

398
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,733
Yeah, right.

399
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,793
God, I need a boyfriend.

400
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,298
You know, Ryan, I'm...

401
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,603
I'm totally
ready to be set up

402
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,371
with one of your
business school friends.

403
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,468
Whenever.

404
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,672
RYAN: Okay.

405
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,585
Oh, my God,
I would get so fat
if I worked here.

406
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,917
Yeah? I lose
my appetite all the time.

407
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,218
You could strip, you know.

408
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,183
Thanks.

409
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,921
So you don't want to
end our relationship?

410
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,723
<i>I'm closer to firing you.</i>

411
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,560
That is so sweet.

412
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,534
You are the best GD
girlfriend in the world.
Do you know that?

413
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,127
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

414
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,467
You are. You are.

415
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,041
So you know
who turned out to
be kind of a creep?

416
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,800
Ben Franklin.

417
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:18,605
And, Elizabeth,
the stripper, gave me
great advice which rhymed.

418
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:25,448
It really makes you wonder how
Ben Franklin can become
President,

419
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,924
but someone like
Elizabeth can't.

420
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,763
Are you
near-sighted
or far-sighted?

421
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,528
Both. That's why I
invented the bifocals.

422
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,660
(EXCLAIMS)
