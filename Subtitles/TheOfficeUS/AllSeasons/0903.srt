1
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,456
Good morning, Dwight.

2
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:11,305
Who are you?

3
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:12,773
Who am I?

4
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,008
I'm Jim.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,544
We've been working together
for 12 years.

6
00:00:16,546 --> 00:00:18,279
Weird joke, Dwight.

7
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,280
You're not Jim.

8
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:20,681
Jim's not Asian.

9
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:22,149
You seriously never noticed?

10
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:25,186
Hey, hats off to you
for not seeing race.

11
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,190
All right then, Jim.

12
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:31,025
Uh, why don't you
tell me about that sale

13
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:33,260
that you made yesterday?

14
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:34,862
Uh, Wellington Systems?

15
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:37,098
Sold them ten cases
of 24-pound letter stock.

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,999
Or were you talking
about Krieger-Murphy?

17
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:40,501
Because I didn't close
that one yet,

18
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:43,404
but I'm hoping I've got a
voicemail from Paul Krieger

19
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:46,040
waiting for me.

20
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:48,409
Please enter your password.

21
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:54,615
You have one new message.

22
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:55,950
How did you know?

23
00:00:55,952 --> 00:00:57,518
No!
No, no.

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,819
That is sensitive information.

25
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:00,988
Only for employees,
not outsiders!

26
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,556
Dwight, cut it out.
I'm trying to work.

27
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:04,725
You don't work here!
You're not Jim!

28
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:06,827
Jim, I got us
that dinner reservation.

29
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:08,129
- Grico's, 7:30.
- Oh, great.

30
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:10,765
Can't wait.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,368
Jim's at the dentist
this morning,

32
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,704
and Steve is
an actor friend of ours.

33
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:18,706
I don't know who you are,

34
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,641
but you are not Jim.

35
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:23,344
<i>This</i> is Jim!

36
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:28,716
Oh, my--

37
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:31,018
oh, d--
oh, how did--

38
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:53,100
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

39
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,011
Hey, study buddies!

40
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,929
Oh-- okay.

41
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:00,798
<i>Getting Things Done.</i>
<i>Awesome!</i>

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,717
It's all about finding ways
to make yourself more efficient.

43
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,935
Life hacking, baby.

44
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,804
This morning, I brushed my teeth
in the shower.

45
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:08,639
Saved myself 90 seconds.

46
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:10,224
Which I just used
to explain this to you.

47
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:11,559
Damn it.

48
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:14,812
Since Andy promoted me
to Assistant Regional Manager,

49
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:16,146
I've been trying
to step my game up.

50
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:17,931
You know, be more productive.

51
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,266
In fact, you know what?

52
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:20,651
Let's knock out a few more of
these sound bites

53
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:23,153
while we're here.

54
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:25,656
Whoa.
That person has really

55
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:29,743
gotten him-- or herself--
into quite a predicament.

56
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:32,296
<i>S'il vous plait...</i>

57
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:35,249
<i>Dites-moi...</i>

58
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:40,621
Ah, French.

59
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:42,473
It's a great language.

60
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:45,009
If you're
a chain-smoking acrobat.

61
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,511
I'm just trying to fit in
better with Andy's family.

62
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:49,597
They all speak
more than one language.

63
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,181
Usually when I'm there.

64
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:53,150
You want to learn a really
impressive second language?

65
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:54,401
Try Dothraki.

66
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:55,853
Win over any man in my guild.

67
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:57,988
Dothraki is the native tongue
of the nomadic,

68
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,774
war-mongering horse lords
of Essos, as featured

69
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:04,278
in the superb Home Box Office
series <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,913
It has a lot of nudity.

71
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:09,333
Which I fast-forward through
to get to the chopped-off heads.

72
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:11,502
I could teach you if you want,
it's a lot easier than French.

73
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:12,620
Yeah.
Let's do it.

74
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,371
<i>- Athdavrazar!</i>
- Oh--

75
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:15,839
It means "excellent."

76
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:16,840
And we have begun.

77
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,662
Is everything okay?

78
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:22,996
Hmm?

79
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:24,298
Oh--
oh, yeah.

80
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,883
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.

81
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,668
Fine, fine, fine.

82
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,887
I mean, I d--
I just don't want to burden you

83
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,805
with my massive
stress freak-outs.

84
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:33,223
Great.

85
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,976
It's just that I am taking
my driver's license test

86
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:38,362
in two days,
and I need to practice

87
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:39,947
with an experienced driver
in the car.

88
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:41,732
But I've had no time
to do that,

89
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:44,985
thanks to "Demandy."

90
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:47,688
I just want
to hit the open road

91
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,024
and drive, man.
But...

92
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:52,209
in whose car?

93
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,411
Nellie!

94
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:57,331
Get your wrinkly old balls
in here.

95
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:04,805
Nellie, I could practice
with you in my car at lunchtime.

96
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,039
Oh, Pam, thank you.

97
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,459
You are my savior.

98
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,895
- Oh, my God--
- Ohh--

99
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:15,349
I'm sorry I'm leaving
you alone for lunch.

100
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,518
Don't worry about it.

101
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,521
I have a thing.

102
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:22,356
A thing of soup.

103
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:26,777
Which I've been wanting to try.

104
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,062
This is my research

105
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:31,398
into how we might produce
child-proof paper

106
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,584
that doesn't give you
paper cuts.

107
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:34,752
We can't.

108
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:38,539
And here is a printout
of your genealogy

109
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,090
from thisisyourfamilytree.com.

110
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:42,209
Executive-summary me.
Hit the highlights.

111
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,744
Well, it turns out

112
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:46,630
you are
a distant blood relative

113
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:49,717
of Michelle Obama.

114
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:50,851
- As in--
- Wife of Barack,

115
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:54,054
loves gardening,
wants to wipe out fat children.

116
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:55,973
Wow.

117
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,392
This is
super-flattering.

118
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:02,479
She's the most popular person
in America.

119
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,715
This is a big day
for both of us.

120
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,400
My fellow Americans,

121
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:08,318
I have a feeling
my approval rating

122
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,771
is about to go
through the roof.

123
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:16,109
Turns out, I am
related to Michelle Obama.

124
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:18,212
I was intimidated
by Andy's family before.

125
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:21,165
And now I have to see
the First Lady at holidays?

126
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,299
She's gonna be like,

127
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,801
"what's your stance
on politics?"

128
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:26,253
Or, "what is
the best war to do?"

129
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:28,555
And I will just be like,

130
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:30,174
"duh--"

131
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:31,308
All right!

132
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,727
We gotta get rid of
all this junk food.

133
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,345
Get fit, America!

134
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:38,932
Not sure if the buzz has reached
the annex yet, but, uh,

135
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:42,319
I'm related to Michelle Obama.

136
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,473
Yeah, we noticed early on

137
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:48,442
Andy really appreciates
enthusiasm.

138
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:50,244
So we decided the best way
to get ahead here

139
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,528
is to be his cheerleaders.

140
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,031
Ohh!

141
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:03,207
It's starting to have this
reverse effect, though,

142
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,959
where I really do think
the stuff he does is awesome.

143
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:07,511
Yeah, me too.
It's weird.

144
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:09,296
Hard to remember what's real
at this point.

145
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,965
Just clap through it, man.

146
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,885
You're logging sales
at ten different times.

147
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:17,771
If you log 'em all at once,
you save a lot of time.

148
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:18,772
It's called batching.

149
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:19,890
This is really good, Darryl.

150
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,442
Life hacking, man.

151
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:22,643
There he is!

152
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:23,677
Andy, you gotta
check this out. He just--

153
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:28,065
Right now I need
canned tuna, okay?

154
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:30,951
Darryl, guess
which talented individual

155
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:33,120
who also has
a killer singing voice

156
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:35,289
is related to the First Lady.

157
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,157
Tracee Ellis Ross.

158
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,961
Daughter of the First Lady
of Motown, Diana Ross.

159
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:41,995
It's me!

160
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,464
I'm related to Michelle Obama.

161
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,165
What?
Really?

162
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,134
I mean, it's distant,
but--

163
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:49,736
That's cool, man.

164
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:50,971
Right?

165
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:53,874
Darryl said,
"cool, man."

166
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:56,209
He called me a cool man.

167
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,565
You know, I really do think it
would be worth it to pull over

168
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,150
and just take
ten minutes to eat.

169
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:05,486
Mm--
the thing is, Pam,

170
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:07,237
I'm gonna be eating
while I'm driving,

171
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,689
so I might as well
get good at it.

172
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,191
Brake lights. Brake lights,
brake lights, brake lights!

173
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:13,026
Whoo!

174
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:15,529
I'm just saying, what does it
imply in this country

175
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:18,198
when a white person shares
an ancestor with a black person?

176
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,834
You think that Andy's family
owned slaves?

177
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:23,236
Well, somebody owned somebody.

178
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:26,840
And I don't think anybody
would buy an Andy.

179
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:27,925
I throat-rip.

180
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,293
<i>Foth aggendak.</i>

181
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,511
You throat-rip.

182
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:31,745
<i>Foth aggendi.</i>

183
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:33,297
He-she-it throat-rips.

184
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:34,348
<i>Foth aggenda.</i>

185
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,582
More of a barbaric growl.

186
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:37,017
<i>Foth aggenda.</i>

187
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,969
Louder. You're shouting it
from the back of a horse.

188
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:40,721
<i>Foth aggenda!</i>

189
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:43,557
Pretty crazy about Andy
and Michelle Obama, huh?

190
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,859
Yeah.

191
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:48,645
It's almost unbelievable.

192
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:49,696
What?

193
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,365
Well, do you know how
Andy has been

194
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,267
really salting
my onions lately?

195
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:55,536
Sure.

196
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:57,704
Well, when he asked me
to look up his ancestry online,

197
00:07:57,706 --> 00:07:59,706
I remembered that news story
about Michelle Obama

198
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,159
having white relatives,
and I just knew

199
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:04,611
he would eat that up.

200
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:07,047
So he's not related
to Michelle Obama?

201
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,415
Pam,

202
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:13,387
I barely know how
to turn on my computer.

203
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,639
Nellie's pretty fearless.

204
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:19,476
And I think she might be
maybe even almost sort of fun.

205
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:20,811
Pam!

206
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:25,983
Well, if there's another
explanation,

207
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,518
I don't really see
what it could possibly be.

208
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,903
I--

209
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,905
What's going on here?

210
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,991
I'm related
to the First Lady, okay?

211
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,776
Get over it.

212
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,945
I still need weekly
status reports from most of you.

213
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:41,031
So can we get
back to work, please?

214
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,199
Get back to work.

215
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:46,870
Andy--

216
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:47,921
Andy, no!

217
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:49,823
I would be very polite today.

218
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:51,491
Why, is it employees' day
or something?

219
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:53,594
I cannot keep track
of these BS holidays.

220
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:55,495
Your connection
to Michelle Obama

221
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:58,999
has certain negative
connotations.

222
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:01,501
Most likely,
your family were...

223
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:03,687
slave owners.

224
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:05,222
Does anyone else
think it's possible

225
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:08,275
that I come from slave owners?

226
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:14,147
Whoa.
That person has really

227
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,700
gotten him-- or herself--
into quite a predicament.

228
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:21,352
Hey, mom, it's Andy.
Give me a call

229
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:22,787
when you get a chance.
Got a quick question for you.

230
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,506
Uh, no big deal, just about
America's national shame.

231
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:27,625
Thanks, bye.

232
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:28,793
Where were we?

233
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,178
Uh-- yes,
okay.

234
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,347
Your... productivity thing.

235
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:33,915
Yes, yes, yes.

236
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:34,933
Great.

237
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:37,252
Ooh, spreadsheets.
Yum, yum.

238
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:38,319
I included some
time-saving ideas.

239
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:39,404
Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh.

240
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,488
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

241
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,824
I'm a teensy bit
distracted right now.

242
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,859
Look, Andy, even
if your ancestors

243
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:47,779
did own slaves,
it wouldn't be your fault.

244
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:50,915
This is only weird
if you make it weird.

245
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,750
Right on, brother.

246
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:53,751
Word dat.

247
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:54,919
Mm--

248
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:58,790
<i>- Ador!</i>
<i>- Daras.</i>

249
00:09:58,792 --> 00:09:59,924
<i>Qazer!</i>

250
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:01,509
<i>Daras.</i>

251
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:03,795
Does anyone here have
fermented mare's milk?

252
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,001
Hey, Erin.

253
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:11,553
<i>Atchomar chomakaan!</i>

254
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:13,605
Oh-- okay.

255
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:15,640
Sorry.

256
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:17,508
Oh, still, it must be great
to have something else going on

257
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,893
outside of work.

258
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:20,695
Yeah--
turn signal.

259
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:22,196
It's exciting to be
painting again--

260
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:23,231
those are the wipers.

261
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,199
So the--
it's just--

262
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,317
there you go.
Yeah.

263
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:29,370
Yeah, things get so busy
with the kids--

264
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:31,873
red light-- that it's nice
to have that creative outlet--

265
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,207
red light, red light,
red, red--

266
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,630
That is brilliant, Pam.

267
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:40,164
I'd love to see
some of your work.

268
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,833
Well, since we're stopped
at a light...

269
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:45,303
uh, here is...

270
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,306
the mural I did
for Angela's baby.

271
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:51,042
That is amazing, Pam.

272
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:54,395
Oh, I love
the lion in the tuxedo.

273
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:59,050
Angela insisted that all
the animals be fully clothed.

274
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:03,404
Hey, has anyone turned in
their status reports up here?

275
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:05,823
<i>Vos.</i>

276
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:08,559
So no?

277
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:10,244
Do you think maybe
you could remind people?

278
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:12,497
I'm trying to downplay the whole
bossy-boss thing today.

279
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:13,531
Because of your slaves.

280
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:17,035
Not my slaves, my ancestors'.

281
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:19,570
Maybe.
Probably not.

282
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:21,506
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

283
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,741
the Dothraki word
for "slave master,"

284
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:28,012
<i>azzafrok, is a term of respect.</i>

285
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:30,014
I'm learning
how to speak Dothraki.

286
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:31,248
Color you impressed?

287
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,051
- That you're learning
a made-up language

288
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:35,470
from HBO's <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

289
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:38,940
I have a lot going on today,

290
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:42,927
but this was
a great nerd-out.

291
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:43,978
Dwight, you didn't tell me
you were teaching me

292
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,313
a fake language.

293
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:47,065
People laughed at Klingon
at first,

294
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:50,818
and now you can major in it.

295
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:54,105
Hi, guys.

296
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:56,290
Hey, boss.
I am so thirsty,

297
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:58,376
can I have a scoop of water?

298
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:00,495
Yeah.
You don't have to ask me--

299
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,466
Ha ha.
Okay, great.

300
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:06,634
Very funny.
I get it.

301
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:08,469
Just because my ancestors
happened to be--

302
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:19,180
Very funny,
Kevin changed my ringtone.

303
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:20,464
Very funny.

304
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,934
I liked the original song
on my ringtone.

305
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:24,569
Which, you may remember,

306
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,821
was <i>Diamonds on the Soles</i>
<i>of Her Shoes </i>by Paul Simon,

307
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:28,472
featuring,

308
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:32,977
Ladysmith African-American
Mombazo.

309
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:38,916
Good. Very good.

310
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:41,502
Oh-- no.

311
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:43,654
Here, it's, uh,
a text from Andy.

312
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:47,041
"New special proj.
Need fam. Tree for evbody.

313
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,677
"Really dig up dirt.
ASAP."

314
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,762
And then in parentheses

315
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:52,263
he wrote out,
"as soon as possible."

316
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:53,431
Mm.

317
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:57,702
Ugh, looks like
it's pretendy time again.

318
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:59,270
Write back,

319
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:01,155
"looking for dirt."

320
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,957
Oh, can I help?

321
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,609
We could say someone
is related to, um,

322
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:07,662
Tonya Harding.

323
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:10,948
Pam, I'm related
to Tonya Harding.

324
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,050
Oh--
gee, I'm--

325
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:15,136
No, I'm just
practicing my lying.

326
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:17,288
- I love it.
- Brilliant.

327
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,424
What should we say about Jim?

328
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:22,727
Um, oh-- uh, say
he's related to Richard Nixon.

329
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:23,845
It's an inside joke.

330
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,730
He looks really Nixony
when he wakes up.

331
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:27,899
My ex behaved like Nixon.

332
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:32,186
All of the lying,
none of the sexual charisma.

333
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,305
I just made a joke then.

334
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:35,406
I'm sorry.

335
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:36,991
It's just, um--

336
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,509
I actually do have
this weird feeling

337
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:40,144
that there's something
Jim isn't telling me.

338
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:42,029
Oh, no.

339
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:43,564
Ugh, an affair.

340
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,817
It is always an affair.

341
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:47,652
Jim?
No.

342
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,787
How can you be sure?

343
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:53,741
Because he just
loves me too much.

344
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:56,961
You're a cocky little thing,
aren't you, Pam?

345
00:13:56,963 --> 00:14:00,998
I have done a little
genealogy research of my own.

346
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,668
Turns out I'm not the only one
with a few skeletons

347
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,803
in the ol' family closet.

348
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,372
For example,

349
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:10,007
Phyllis'
great-great-grandmother

350
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,311
was responsible for spreading
cholera to the United States.

351
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:14,395
Ew.

352
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:17,181
Kevin is related to both
John Wayne Gacy

353
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,850
and John Wayne Bobbitt.

354
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:21,319
And John Wayne?

355
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:22,820
No. Not that
I see here.

356
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:25,606
Wayne Johnson?
The Rock?

357
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:28,693
You mean Dwayne, and no.

358
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,528
What about Jim Halpert?
Uh-oh.

359
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,397
Turns out, distant relative
of the reviled

360
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,283
Richard Nixon.

361
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:37,368
Pam always says
I look like Nixon.

362
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,170
That's crazy, right?

363
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,756
I mean, there's nothing there.

364
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:46,577
Tru--

365
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:48,996
Oh, no.

366
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:50,097
Dwight's grandfather--

367
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,883
Was a member of the Bund,

368
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,935
which is not technically
the same thing

369
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:54,969
as the Nazi party.

370
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:57,638
So--

371
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,774
I was gonna say
he was a tax evader.

372
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,776
Oh.

373
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:03,861
I was joking about
that whole Bund thing.

374
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:05,696
Oh-ho, the look
on your faces.

375
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:10,401
And Meredith
is a blood relative

376
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:11,485
of Lizzie Borden.

377
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:12,620
Cool.

378
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:14,939
Stop it! Stop it,
you're frightening me.

379
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:16,707
Andy, did you call this meeting

380
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,043
just to talk junk
about our families?

381
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:21,111
Yeah, that-- you're being
really mean.

382
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:23,447
No, I'm proving a point, okay?

383
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,115
We all have ancestors
who may have

384
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:27,284
done horrible things
in the past.

385
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,720
But it's in the past,
and it's not our fault.

386
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:31,622
So we don't have
to talk about it.

387
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:33,975
The difference is, Andy,
that you're the only one here

388
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:36,811
still benefitting
from the terrible things

389
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:37,962
your ancestors did.

390
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:40,765
Might have done,
and how do you figure?

391
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,433
Your family's rich.

392
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:43,818
I have to believe
that a big part

393
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,470
of the Bernard fortune was
earned on the backs of slaves.

394
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:47,605
You know, there's nothing wrong

395
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,306
with being successful
in America, Oscar.

396
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:51,692
I'm not gonna apologize
for my family's wealth.

397
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:55,145
That wealth could one day
benefit society,

398
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:57,131
if capital gains are ever
taxed at the same rate

399
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,182
as earned income.

400
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,836
Okay, Kevin did that.

401
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,505
I do not wish I was in Dixie.

402
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,756
Hey, mom.
How are you?

403
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,676
Did any Bernards ever own

404
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:12,013
a plantation in the South?

405
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:13,598
She said no.
Take that!

406
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,900
Follow-up question,
did any Bernards

407
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:18,936
ever make money
in an unsavory way?

408
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,076
I just
asked you--

409
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,994
why didn't you
used to say that?

410
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:28,696
Okay, stop, stop.

411
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:29,947
Stop talking.
Stop talking.

412
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,950
That's-- no.
I don't want to know that.

413
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,335
Okay, you're interrupting
a meeting.

414
00:16:34,337 --> 00:16:35,369
I have to go.

415
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:38,122
Love you.
Bye.

416
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:41,509
Well, turns out the Bernards
of yore did not own slaves.

417
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:42,760
Really.

418
00:16:42,762 --> 00:16:44,345
We merely transported them.

419
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:48,182
Which, at worst,
makes us amoral middlemen.

420
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:54,918
Yo, D-Dog.
I need your help.

421
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:58,955
I'm trying to think of things
I can say that make it

422
00:16:58,957 --> 00:17:00,456
sound like I had a sore
difficult childhood

423
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,557
than I actually had.

424
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,926
- You gonna po' mouth.
- Exactly.

425
00:17:02,928 --> 00:17:04,143
Help me po' mouth, Darryl.

426
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:06,596
Actually, Andy,
you promised me five minutes

427
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:08,097
to talk about productivity
suggestions--

428
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,483
What if I said
that my dad beat me,

429
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,936
and I just left out
the croquet of it all?

430
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:15,321
Or, I could just go all the way

431
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:16,873
and say I grew up
in an apartment.

432
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,608
Or is that too crazy?

433
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,560
That could work.

434
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:22,278
You know, Darryl, this is

435
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,747
textbook assistant regional
manager stuff here,

436
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:27,583
and I feel like I'm doing
all the heavy lifting.

437
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:29,986
I'm coming up
with all the ideas here.

438
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:32,005
I'm going for a walk.

439
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,040
Okay.

440
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:41,130
Good...

441
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:42,265
Good, and--

442
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:56,396
You doing all right, man?

443
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:58,731
I'm done.

444
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,867
I gotta get out of here.

445
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:02,368
Yeah.

446
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,321
Not the easiest day to be
Assistant Regional Manager.

447
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:08,124
It's not just today,
it's every day.

448
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:10,043
Seems like
the better title I have,

449
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,861
the stupider my job gets.

450
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:15,381
Aw, come on, it can always
get better, right?

451
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:18,251
Hmm.
Yeah, right.

452
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:19,335
No, I'm serious.

453
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:21,838
There's always
something better.

454
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,056
Like what?

455
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,925
Like, hypothetically,

456
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:29,095
if I said that
there was another job

457
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:31,547
that you and I could both have.

458
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,382
What kind of job?

459
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:38,688
Something cool,
like sports marketing, or--

460
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,189
does that sound like
something you'd be into?

461
00:18:40,191 --> 00:18:41,357
- Hell yeah.
- Right?

462
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,408
That sounds awesome.

463
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,526
Okay, but wait.
What if I told you

464
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:44,577
that it was in Philly?

465
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,279
- So you'd have to--
- I love Philly.

466
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:47,663
Right?

467
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:49,532
- It's not even a thought--
- Not even a thought.

468
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:53,286
It's not even that far away,
I could still commute-- exactly.

469
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:54,954
Exactly.

470
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,906
All right.

471
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:58,007
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

472
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,675
So what, is this happening?

473
00:18:59,677 --> 00:19:01,511
Oh, it's happening.

474
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:02,845
Let's just keep it
between you and me

475
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,130
- for right now, all right?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:05,414
For sure, for sure, for sure.

477
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,301
Man.
And Pam's into it?

478
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:09,552
We gotta have a talk about it,

479
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:10,937
but I think
that she's--

480
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,105
I think she understands...

481
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,439
- Aw, come on, man.
- ...what this is.

482
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:14,807
I thought you had
something real.

483
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:15,892
What?
No, no, no.

484
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:17,193
Come on.
This is real.

485
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:19,428
It's not real

486
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,483
until your wife is on board.

487
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,602
So what did you
want to show me?

488
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:29,705
That is quite an ugly wall,
isn't it?

489
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:31,774
Yeah.
It's really ugly.

490
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:33,576
Needs something, doesn't it?

491
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:34,794
I'm thinking,

492
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:37,797
a mural.

493
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,831
You mean me?

494
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,832
Yes, you.

495
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,668
You are so talented.

496
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,504
It's going to be my next
special project.

497
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:47,090
Hiring Scranton's most
dangerous young muralist

498
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:49,092
to paint the warehouse wall.

499
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:50,560
Oh, my God, I love it!

500
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:51,978
Uh-- I--
Nellie,

501
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,729
this is brilliant!

502
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:54,847
- Hey!
- Hey.

503
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:56,732
Can I talk to you for a second?

504
00:19:56,734 --> 00:20:00,103
Anything you have
to say to her,

505
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:01,137
you can say to me.

506
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:02,188
She never loved you.

507
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,940
What? No, I--
I got this.

508
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:05,141
Okay.

509
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,308
Okay.
This is his fault.

510
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,860
It is not your fault.

511
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:11,497
I am gonna find you
someone better, and rich.

512
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:13,449
And Filipino.

513
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:17,420
But we'll break that
to her later.

514
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:19,205
You know what
this is all about?

515
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:20,923
Yeah.

516
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:21,991
You too, huh?

517
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:25,494
Yeah.

518
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:28,598
Go on, spill it.

519
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,435
Tell her all the gory details,
you snake.

520
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:33,769
Hey.

521
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:35,454
He deserves this.

522
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:39,308
And he said I could
get in on it too.

523
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,145
Yeah.

524
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:44,897
Oh, Pam, no.

525
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,782
Oh, I can't bear to watch this.

526
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:48,951
I don't know what I was
so worried about.

527
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:52,622
I have the best wife
in the world.

528
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:55,641
I still can't believe
he didn't tell me.

529
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:05,961
I was helping
Nellie drive--

530
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:08,798
Do not care.

531
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,671
<i>Fonas chek!</i>

532
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:18,307
<i>Dothras chek!</i>

533
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,712
I like that guy.

534
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,765
We should hook him up
with Meredith.

535
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:26,682
Hmm--

536
