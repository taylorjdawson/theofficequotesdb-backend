1
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,740
<i>RYAN: Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.</i>

2
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,839
I got Jim's old job,

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,577
which means
at my 10-year high school reunion,

4
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,119
it will not say, "Ryan Howard is a temp."

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,156
It will say,
"Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate

6
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,283
"at a mid-range paper supply firm."

7
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,318
That'll show them.

8
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,610
You have no idea
how long I've wanted to do that.

9
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,111
Me, too.

10
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,821
I think we're just drunk.

11
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,052
No, I'm not drunk.

12
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,720
Are you drunk?
No.

13
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,324
Jim.

14
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,229
You're really going to marry him?

15
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,372
Okay.

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,718
Jim is gone.

17
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,312
He's gone. I miss him so much.

18
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:33,189
I cry myself to sleep. Jim.

19
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,659
False. I do not miss him.

20
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,789
No. That is the fun of this place.

21
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,832
I call everybody faggy.
Why would anyone find that offensive?

22
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,766
Okay. I think Oscar would just like it
if you used lame or something like that.

23
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,359
That's what faggy means.

24
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,995
No, not really.
Oh.

25
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,597
Apparently you called Oscar faggy.

26
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,698
Yeah.

27
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:26,108
For liking the movie Shakespeare in Love
more than an action movie.

28
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,477
It wasn't just an action movie,
it was Die Hard.

29
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,675
All right, Michael, but Oscar's really gay.

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,342
Exactly.
I mean for real.

31
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,444
Yeah, I know.
No. He's attracted to other men.

32
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,491
Okay. Little too far. Crossed the line.

33
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,458
Okay. I am telling you,

34
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,792
Oscar is an actual homosexual.

35
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,963
Yeah. He told me this morning.

36
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,401
And obviously he hopes
he can count on your discretion.

37
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,597
I would have never
called him that if I knew.

38
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:58,235
You don't call retarded people retards.

39
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,040
It's bad taste.

40
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,776
You call your friends retards
when they're acting retarded.

41
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,410
And I consider Oscar a friend.

42
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:11,351
Listen, man, I am so sorry. I had no idea.

43
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,221
Oh, it's fine. It's okay. It's okay.
No. No.

44
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,785
It's okay.
No, it's not. I just... I feel terrible about it.

45
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,924
I have been calling people faggy
since I was in junior high,

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,434
and I have never made this mistake.

47
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,232
If I don't know how to behave,

48
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:30,004
it is because I am
just so far the opposite way.

49
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,600
You know? I'm just...

50
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,444
I... I can't even imagine the thing...

51
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:41,119
Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime
and you could tell me

52
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,247
how you do that to another dude.

53
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,553
That sounds like a great, wonderful idea.
Let's do that.

54
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,175
It explains so much.

55
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,852
No. I'm not gay.

56
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,017
And I don't understand
why anyone would think that I'm gay if...

57
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,032
Yeah, I'm gay.

58
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,639
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper
is less flammable, sir,

59
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,304
but I can assure you
that it is certainly not more flammable.

60
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,275
<i>JIM: Why did I transfer to Stamford?</i>

61
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,142
I think that's pretty obvious.

62
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,777
I got promoted.

63
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,255
And you can't beat that view, right?

64
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,452
Hey, Big Tuna, you're single, right?

65
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,361
Yeah, I am.

66
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,798
Pretty hot, huh?

67
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,997
She's completely crazy.

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,333
Steer clear, Big Tuna.

69
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,671
Head for open waters.

70
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,275
Okay.
Okay.

71
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:23,950
JIM: I ate a tuna sandwich on my first day,
so Andy started calling me Big Tuna.

72
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,888
I don't think any of them
actually know my real name.

73
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,929
Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy,

74
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,932
you know, cut your throat
to get ahead type of guy.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,060
But, I mean, I'm not threatened by him.

76
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,936
I went to Cornell. You ever heard of it?

77
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,100
I graduated in four years,
I never studied once,

78
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,973
I was drunk the whole time

79
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:49,913
and I sang in the a cappella group
Here Comes Treble.

80
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:55,012
So, end of day we are going to have
a little diversity policy freshener

81
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,148
because of some more problems
at the Scranton branch.

82
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:02,183
And I have a list of business start-ups
I got from the chamber.

83
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,196
Yes. I am going to need
someone to cold call them.

84
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,027
Oh, I can do that.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,433
<i>KAREN: Jim's nice enough.</i>

86
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,502
I don't know how well he's fitting in here.

87
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:17,404
He's always looking at the camera, like this.

88
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,139
What is that?

89
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,076
Can you tell who's gay and who is not?
Of course.

90
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,844
What about Oscar?

91
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,284
Absolutely not.
Well, he is.

92
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,822
Well, he's not dressed
in women's clothes, so...

93
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,986
There could be others.

94
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,155
I need to know.
I don't want to offend anybody else.

95
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,601
You could assume everyone is
and not say anything offensive.

96
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,761
Yeah.

97
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,933
I'm sure everyone would appreciate me
treating them like they were gay.

98
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,740
Hey, what about Angela?

99
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,872
She's hard and severe.
She could be a gay woman.

100
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,143
I really don't think so.
I don't know.

101
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:03,086
I can imagine her with another woman,
can't you?

102
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,291
Do some research.

103
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,727
Find out if there's a way to tell
by just looking at them.

104
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,960
Jim told me you could buy gaydar online.

105
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,866
That's ridiculous.
Yeah. Probably.

106
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,961
He didn't tell the truth a lot.

107
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,071
Let's call him and get the website.
Definitely.

108
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,842
What's gaydar?

109
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:29,007
Oh, oh, gaydar, <i>yes!</i>
No, I think they have it at Sharper Image.

110
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,579
Oh, you know what? I can check for you.

111
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,777
No problem.

112
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,680
It's sold out.

113
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,860
Yeah. Sorry about that. That's a bummer.

114
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,959
They're sold out.
Damn.

115
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,626
I'll try Brookstone.

116
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,230
I miss that.

117
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,608
Chicken or fish?

118
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,980
Chicken.

119
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,692
So, you having a good day?
Excellent. Thanks.

120
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,259
Good. I'm glad.

121
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,725
Okay.

122
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,330
<i>PAM: Yeah, I didn't go through</i>
<i>with the wedding.</i>

123
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,841
<i>I got cold feet a few days before,</i>

124
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,935
<i>and I can't really explain it.</i>

125
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,276
<i>I just had to get out of that relationship.</i>

126
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,545
We still had to pay for all the food,
so we froze it.

127
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,452
But I'm doing well.

128
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,652
I have my own apartment
and I'm taking art classes.

129
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,928
And I have lunch for the next five weeks.

130
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,725
After Pam dumped me,

131
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:57,030
I kind of stopped taking care of myself
for a while there,

132
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,561
and I hit bottom
when I had a drunk driving arrest.

133
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,242
Yeah, I've been working out and, you know,

134
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,042
I'm not going to take her for granted.

135
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,048
I got to win her back.

136
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,723
I got them a toaster.

137
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,318
They called off the wedding
and gave the toaster back to me.

138
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,023
I tried to return the toaster to the store
and they said

139
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,258
they no longer sold that kind of toaster.

140
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,530
So now my house has got two toasters.

141
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:40,136
It is so cool that you're gay.
I totally underestimated you.

142
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,045
Yes, I am super cool.

143
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,879
I am an accountant

144
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,285
at a failing paper supply company
in Scranton.

145
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,248
Much like Sir lan McKellen.

146
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,260
<i>ANGELA: Sure, sometimes I watch</i>
Will & Grace <i>and I want to throw up.</i>

147
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,494
It's terribly loud.

148
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:08,132
I do like it sometimes
when Harry Connick Jr. Is on.

149
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,835
He's so talented.

150
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,654
Okay,

151
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,128
who put my calculator in JELL-O?

152
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,759
Good one.

153
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,400
But, seriously, guys, who did this?

154
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,378
Seriously, guys. Who did this?

155
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,351
I need to know
who put my calculator in JELL-O

156
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,820
or I'm going to lose my freaking <i>mind!</i>

157
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,634
You know, it's amazing to me
that in this day and age,

158
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:13,001
you can be so obtuse
about sexual orientation.

159
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,200
I watch <i>The L Word,</i> okay?
JAN: Good. Good.

160
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,505
(BLEEPING)
I watch <i>Queer as...</i> so...

161
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,010
That's not what it's called.

162
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,276
Okay, Michael, are you aware
that you outed Oscar today?

163
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,214
What? What does that even...

164
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:29,186
Coming out is a significant moment
for a gay person.

165
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,416
And they should be allowed
to select the timing

166
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,117
and manner of announcing it.

167
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,319
Well, gay pride, right?

168
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,021
Gay pride parade.

169
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,554
It's not, like, gay shame festival.

170
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:44,433
All right, now Oscar's feeling
discriminated against by his co-workers,

171
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,472
primarily Angela, and that's your fault.

172
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,974
I think Angela might be gay.

173
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,272
Could Oscar and Angela
be having a gay affair?

174
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,710
JAN: <i>No!</i>
Maybe. Is that what this is about?

175
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,011
No. No. It's not possible.
I don't...

176
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:03,215
Anything's possible.
Okay, you know, imagine you were gay.

177
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,250
Well, I'm not gay, Jan,

178
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,384
and you should know that
better than anybody.

179
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,955
Michael, your immaturity
is extremely disappointing

180
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,590
and may even lead to a lawsuit,

181
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,931
which is the absolute last thing
this company needs right now.

182
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,435
Yes.
Do you understand?

183
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,493
I know.

184
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,700
The company has made it
my responsibility today

185
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:28,336
to put an end to 100,000 years
of being weirded out by gays.

186
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,348
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?

187
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,746
Trick question.

188
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,311
'Cause you can't always tell,
so how would I know?

189
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,586
Was that the right answer?

190
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,784
Yup.

191
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,126
Michael, Dwight's looking
at gay pornography on his computer.

192
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,291
Michael knows, Pam, okay?
He asked me to do this just for him.

193
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,460
He has his own reasons.

194
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,032
Okay.

195
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,103
Nothing wrong with this stuff at all.

196
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,406
This is fine.

197
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,574
You know what?
Gay porn, straight porn, it's all good.

198
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,848
I don't particularly get into this
but, you know what,

199
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,257
I totally see the merit. And actually,

200
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,159
it is quite beautiful.

201
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,320
Oh, damn pop-ups.
What are you doing?

202
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,957
Watching some of your friends.
This is stupid. Excuse me.

203
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,432
Don't touch <i>me!</i>

204
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,729
(EXCLAIMING)

205
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,499
<i>Hey!</i> Whoa, whoa, <i>whoa!</i> Stop <i>it!</i>

206
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,472
All right, everybody in the conference <i>room!</i>

207
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,999
I don't care if you are gay, or straight,

208
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,376
or a lesbian or overweight, just get in <i>here!</i>

209
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,607
Right <i>now!</i>

210
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,882
Did you know that gay used to mean happy?

211
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,013
When I was growing up, it meant lame.

212
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,253
And now it means a man

213
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,389
who makes love to other men.

214
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,764
We're all homos, <i>Homo sapiens.</i>

215
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,667
Gays aren't necessarily
who you think they are...

216
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,829
What?
...people.

217
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,169
I mean, anybody can be gay.

218
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,972
Businessmen, like antique dealers,

219
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,446
or hairdressers or

220
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,483
accountants.

221
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,214
Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity
to officially come out

222
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,553
to everybody here
however you want to do it?

223
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,218
Go ahead. Stand up.

224
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,657
I'm doing this for you.

225
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,801
Yes, I'm gay.

226
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:35,098
And I didn't plan on sharing
that part of my life with you today,

227
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,836
so, whatever.

228
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,104
Can I sit down now?

229
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,408
<i>CREED: I'm not offended by homosexuality.</i>

230
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,808
In the '60s, I made love to many,
many women, often outdoors,

231
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,013
in the mud and the rain,

232
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,989
and it's possible a man slipped in.

233
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,048
There would be no way of knowing.

234
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:59,154
Who should be the judges
and juries of our society?

235
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,563
Judges and juries.
Yes.

236
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,602
That's a good point. She has a good point.

237
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:08,971
Because gay marriage currently
is not legal under U.S. Law.

238
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,977
I bet a lot of straight men wished
that applied to them

239
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,411
so they could go out there
and have some torrid,

240
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,848
unabashed monkey sex
as much as they could. You know?

241
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,512
Sounds pretty good, right?
That sounds great.

242
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,816
Yeah, Dwight.

243
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,086
I think all the other office gays
should identify themselves

244
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,148
or I will do it for them.

245
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,956
No one else in this office is gay.

246
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,223
What about Phyllis?

247
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,061
She makes absolutely no attempt
to be feminine.

248
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,727
I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
STANLEY: You are?

249
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,327
No <i>way!</i>
RYAN: Congratulations, Phyllis.

250
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,566
When did you get that?
MICHAEL: That's great.

251
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,304
Congratulations, Phyllis.
That is great, and frankly, kind of amazing.

252
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,006
See? Everybody has a chance.
Thank you.

253
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,346
But, still Phyllis, in college,

254
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,318
did you ever experiment with other women?

255
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,752
A lot of women do.

256
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,290
No, and you knew me in high school.

257
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,953
Of course, we all thought
you were gay in high school.

258
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,086
Right.

259
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,528
(LAUGHING)

260
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,800
And I take that as a compliment.

261
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,859
Well, with your ties
and your matching socks...

262
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,405
Well, I just like to look good, okay? So...

263
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,963
You sound pretty defensive, Michael.

264
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,875
No. I am just coming out myself.
I am coming out <i>hetero!</i>

265
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,970
I think the problem with this office is

266
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,743
that you are sending mixed signals
about my being here.

267
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:29,618
No. No. The only signal that I am sending
is gay <i>good!</i>

268
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,286
Look, if I was gay,

269
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:37,819
I would be the most flamboyant gay
you've ever seen.

270
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:42,230
I would be leading the parade
covered in feathers and just...

271
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,395
I'd be waving that rainbow flag.

272
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,638
I don't think I can work here any longer.

273
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,608
This has been the worst,

274
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,077
most backwards day of my life.

275
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,376
You misunderstand... Okay. All right...

276
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,814
You know what? Okay. Okay.

277
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,481
I'm going to put my money
where my mouth is.

278
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,680
You ready?
What are you doing?

279
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,418
I am going to embrace Oscar.
You might want to watch us, Angela,

280
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,858
because you can't catch anything.
Here we go.

281
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,394
No.
We are going to make a statement.

282
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,693
You and I are going to make
a statement together.

283
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,529
Oscar is my friend.
I'd rather not.

284
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,001
And I just don't care who sees it.

285
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,061
Doesn't bother me.
Really, I really would rather not.

286
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,504
Come here, friend.
I'd really rather not.

287
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,803
You're my friend.
<i>No! No!</i>

288
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,539
I don't want to touch you.
Ever considered that?

289
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,276
You're ignorant and insulting and small.

290
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,573
Okay.

291
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,553
All right.

292
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,261
I'm sorry. Michael, I'm sorry.

293
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,436
That was a good idea. Come on.

294
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,327
Come on.

295
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,036
All right.

296
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,641
I'm sorry I called you faggy.
I know. I know.

297
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,236
You're not faggy.
I know you are.

298
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,805
You're a good guy.
You, too.

299
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,851
<i>DWIGHT: Michael appears to be gay, too.</i>

300
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,384
And yet he is my friend.

301
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,855
I guess I do have a gay friend.

302
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,723
You know what,
I'm going to raise the stakes.

303
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,022
You don't...

304
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,791
I want you to watch this

305
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,398
and I want you to burn this into your brains.

306
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,793
I don't think we need to do this...

307
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,430
Because this is an image

308
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:31,966
that I want you people to remember
for a long time to come.

309
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,673
Whenever you come into the office,
I want you to think about this.

310
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,305
We don't need to.

311
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,077
Yes, we do.
What?

312
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,351
(GRUNTING)

313
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,265
I did <i>it!</i>

314
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,331
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

315
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,461
See,

316
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,299
I'm still here.

317
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,901
We're all still here.

318
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,783
Oh, come on, <i>Dwight!</i> Come on, <i>man!</i>

319
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:18,789
We are not in the playground anymore.
There are new rules.

320
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,252
We have to be mature,

321
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:26,628
but we can't lose the spirit
of childlike wonder.

322
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,429
<i>What is love anyway?</i>

323
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,169
<i>Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules.</i>

324
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,369
<i>Like me and Jan.</i>

325
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,601
<i>Or Oscar and some guy. Life is short.</i>

326
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,313
<i>When two people find each other,</i>

327
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,249
<i>what should stand in their way?</i>

328
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,147
BROWN: It is very easy for you
to be a hero.

329
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:53,282
All you need are honesty, empathy,
respect and open-mindedness.

330
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,656
I'm glad if today spurred social change.

331
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,889
That's part of my job as regional manager.

332
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,125
But, you know what, even if it didn't,

333
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,725
at least we put this matter to bed.

334
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,465
That's what she said. Or he said.

335
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,043
Oh, there's Gil, Oscar's roommate.

336
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,443
I wonder if he knows.

337
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,147
I was going to quit,

338
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:30,161
but Jan offered me a three-month,
paid vacation and a company car.

339
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,130
All I had to do was sign something
saying I won't sue.

340
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,432
Gil and I are going to Europe.

341
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,868
Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.

342
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,406
"Hope this helps. Jim."

343
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,013
Nice.

344
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,525
What are you doing?
(SHUSHING) Don't be scared.

345
