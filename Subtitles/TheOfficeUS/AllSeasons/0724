[Ringing]

180
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:25,121
Well...
It's just...

181
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:27,290
[Ringing]
It messes up my rhythm.

182
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:28,391
But...

183
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,360
I'm taking a break from dating.

184
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:33,963
Gabe was a great guy with
so many wonderful qualities,

185
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:36,866
but it was a challenge
being touched by him.

186
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,168
Wow. You've really embraced

187
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:39,969
the whole bond villain
aesthetic.

188
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:41,271
Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim.

189
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:43,540
The gun is a beaumont-Adams.
Jo collects them.

190
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,042
I thought we could have
some nice small talk about it.

191
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,011
And the piranha's a rescue.

192
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:49,679
And the desk.

193
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:51,981
The desk is a replica
of Uday Hussein's desk.

194
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:53,316
<i>I saw a picture in newsweek.</i>

195
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:54,551
Listen, I'm a very busy man.

196
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,885
Let's get right down
to business.

197
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,620
- Okay.
- Jo is coming later today.

198
00:08:57,688 --> 00:08:59,722
I cannot have a subordinate
trying to make me look stupid.

199
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,124
Okay?
I need you to promise me

200
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,158
that you'll be
on your best behavior.

201
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,993
I promis...ed
other people

202
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:05,829
that I'd be
on my worst behavior.

203
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:07,664
And I gave them my word, so...

204
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:09,332
Don't make me fire you.

205
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,468
You can't fire me.
You're acting manager.

206
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:13,937
Not office manager.
So you have no firing powers.

207
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,172
Don't make me pre-fire you.

208
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
You wouldn't dare.

209
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:20,443
Watch this.
You're pre-fired.

210
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:23,513
And when I'm promoted,
you'll be full fired.

211
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,982
<i>[Quietly] If you get promoted,</i>

212
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,785
<i>and if you haven't fallen
in love with me by then.</i>

213
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:29,919
What?

214
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,321
If I had thought

215
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,555
that there was a real chance

216
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,190
that Dwight would be
permanent manager,

217
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:35,458
I would have pre-quit.

218
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:36,926
And you might be saying
to yourself,

219
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,828
"well, that's pretty
premature to think,"

220
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:42,966
but I always say it's better
to be pre-pre-preprepared.

221
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,301
- How you doing, Jordan?
- I'm good.

222
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:46,870
Everyone here thinks
that you're a joke.

223
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:48,771
They think that you were hired

224
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,074
because of your good looks,
which won't last long anyway.

225
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:53,076
As your pale skin
and severe bone structure imply,

226
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:54,577
you'll age swiftly and poorly.

227
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:56,145
Why are you telling me this?

228
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:59,315
Now I want you to find out
what people are saying about me,

229
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:01,751
things they don't want me
to know abou--

230
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,924
Ohh...

231
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:12,996
It's a holster.

232
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:20,503
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

233
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:25,775

Ohh...

00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:32,515
Oh, what a day.
What a day.

236
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,451
Dwight, are you carrying a gun?

237
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,387
The holster was a gift
from my great-uncle honk.

238
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:38,688
Um, I don't know.

239
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,590
I guess he's saying
that he's proud of me.

240
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:43,359
Dwight, guns make me
really uncomfortable.

241
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:45,995
The gun is just an accessory
to the holster, okay?

242
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,097
I can't walk around
wearing an empty holster.

243
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,266
Why do you need to wear
the holster at all?

244
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,535
Why do you need to keep
wearing those booby shirts

245
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:54,304
all the time?
Thank you.

246
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:56,272
You could put your
cell phone in it instead.

247
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,207
Uh...Hello!

248
00:10:58,275 --> 00:10:59,509
You could put a banana in it.

249
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,177
Why would I put a banana
in my holster?

250
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,679
In case you weren't hungry now

251
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,781
but you got hungry later.

252
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:08,017
Dwight, no gun, okay?
Don't make us call Jo.

253
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,987
Okay, all right, fine.
Everyone calm down.

254

Oh my God.

260
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,815
There is a hardwood floor
underneath this carpeting.

261
00:11:29,883 --> 00:11:32,184

Hey, what happened?

269
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,934
Dwight went on
a shooting spree,

270
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,469
and then he shot Andy
in the head.

271
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,371
No, no, no.
All we know is that a gun fired.

No. That's not true.

we heard a loud noise.

leave the gun.

already be on the plane.

Why are you calling Jo?

00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:16,495

go to the hospital.

- I'll go with you.
- No!

in the office today.

- What?
- I am telling you this

452
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:45,984
because I care too much
about this job

453

into doing it poorly.

All I've ever wanted
is to be manager here.

455

And if you feel like
you cannot promote me

over this one accident,
I understand.

457
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,763
But if you think
that extortion is worse--

458
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,065
Shooting is worse!

459
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:02,567

It's not even in the same--

00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:05,771
You shot a gun?
What is wrong with you?

461
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:07,406
It was a Beaumont-Adams,
if that helps.

462
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,740
Beaumont-Adams
is a girl's gun.

463
00:19:08,808 --> 00:19:09,908
That just makes it
plain stupid.

464
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,176
I take full responsibility.

465
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:12,644
Who else would be responsible?

466
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:15,847

a banana in my holster.

467
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,115

468
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:18,850
Okay. Did I make a mistake?
Yes.

469
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:22,688
Do I regret the decision
that I made? Yes.

easy questions

00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:01,560
- Yep.
- Yep.

483
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:04,396
Till then, we need
a new actin' manager.

Now, who's got the most
experience in this office?

00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:12,738

wanna go just on seniority.

Okay. Well...

You do know that Jo was right

00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,719
to take the job away
from you, right?

492
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:29,488
There's no debating that.

493
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:31,823
But I will say...
