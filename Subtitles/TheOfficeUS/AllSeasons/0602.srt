1
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:03,252
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Oscar, come on in.

2
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:05,486
Close the door, if you would.

3
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:07,925
Thanks so much for talking to me.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:08,966
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:11,433
I'm going in for a procedure today.

6
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:13,008
Is everything okay?

7
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,973
It's routine.
I'm just a little bit scared.

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,933
I'm sure everything will be fine.

9
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:20,436
What's the procedure,
if you don't mind my asking?

10
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:22,691
It is a colonoscopy.

11
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:28,447
In your experience,
what should I be expecting

12
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:30,272
in terms of sensation...

13
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,757
or emotions?

14
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:42,101
Is there anything

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,613
I can do to make it more pleasurable

16
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:46,504
for me or for Dr. Chaudry?

17
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:52,426
My main concern is
should I have a safe word?

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,366
The Office 6x02
- The Meeting -

27
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,452
You think you can get me a rundown
on the Buffalo clients by Monday?

28
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:20,429
You know what?
I'll do you one better.

29
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:21,872
Sunday, Sunday night.

30
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,582
Okay, I will get it Monday.

31
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:25,643
Hold on, big guy.

32
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:28,713
I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday.
You'll get it Wednesday.

33
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,798
Jim, you want to hit
the conference room?

34
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:32,007
Good luck.

35
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,466
Right, this thing.
I remember now.

36
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:37,443
- What's this about?
- This is me and David, if it's okay.

37
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:39,855
That's okay with me,
he's gonna want me in.

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,183
It's okay. We got it.

39
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:42,268
Really?

40
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,297
Do you mind if I sit this out?

41
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:47,648
I have so much work,
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

42
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:01,704
Am I worried that Jim and David
are having a meeting without me?

43
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:05,629
Because we are
the Three Amigos.

44
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:09,438
And once in a while,
one of the <i>amigos</i> will go off

45
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:13,395
to the bathroom while the other two
have a secret meeting.

46
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:21,932
Let me escort you to your desk.

47
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,687
It's just...

48
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:25,605
three or four steps, but thank you.

49
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,580
You and Jim are close, huh?

50
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:30,588
I think the pregnancy
really brought us together.

51
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,693
What do you think
he and David are talking about?

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,033
- I don't know.
- You said good luck to Jim.

53
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:39,934
Did I?

54
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,828
Doesn't sound like me.
I'm not very superstitious.

55
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,586
If you're lying to me right now,

56
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,880
your baby is gonna come out a liar.

57
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:55,884
That's how it works.

58
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,199
They inherit things
through the breast milk.

59
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:00,839
Please don't talk
about my breast milk.

60
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,656
I just don't want you to lie to me.

61
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:06,393
I don't want you to ever lie to me.
Have I ever lied to you?

62
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,355
I just don't want you to.

63
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,302
I was rushing to fill an order.

64
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:14,401
I put the ladder up to grab
a box of three-hole from the top shelf.

65
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:17,154
Next thing I know, I'm on the ground,
ladder's on top of me.

66
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,783
And that's how you broke your ankle?

67
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:21,698
Interesting.

68
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:24,483
How did the ladder
end up on top of you

69
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,056
if you fell off of it?

70
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:28,419
This doesn't concern you.
You need to walk away.

71
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,750
Really? I'm sorry.
I thought this was a free country.

72
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,837
I didn't know
we were in communist Sweden.

73
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,757
If we were, I wouldn't have to worry,
'cause we'd have universal health care.

74
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,896
- Be quiet.
- I'm talking...

75
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,955
I will send this off to corporate,
hold on to your medical bills.

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,180
Feel better.

77
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,572
Thanks, T-man.

78
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,905
Later.

79
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:51,689
So long, Darryl.

80
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:52,957
Feel better.

81
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:54,392
He's lying.

82
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,569
He has a doctor's note.

83
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,037
From who, Dr. J?

84
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,444
You really need to investigate this.

85
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,480
People don't just fall off
of ladders.

86
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,619
Guy on my street fell off
painting his house. It was on the news.

87
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,332
Since when have you known Darryl
to rush to do anything

88
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,840
other than to come up here
for birthday cake?

89
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:12,647
"Y'all having birthday cake?"

90
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:15,129
That's not a very good Darryl.

91
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,756
How many foremen do you know
that pull boxes?

92
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:21,241
It just doesn't add up.

93
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:27,253
We did a little investigation,
and Dwight had a good point.

94
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:29,158
The ladder didn't reach
the top shelf.

95
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:31,437
I don't know if I believe it, but...

96
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,094
I am a fan
of the hardboiled detective novel.

97
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:36,332
"I'll punch you into mush, see?"

98
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,271
Well, if he doesn't like it,
you can tell that S.O.B.

99
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:43,294
that he is fired.
Sorry, I'm going into a meeting.

100
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,419
I will... I love you too. Bye.

101
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,537
- Who was that?
- Sorry about that. What'd I miss?

102
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:51,247
We would like to continue
this meeting in private,

103
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,650
- please, if you don't mind.
- I do not mind.

104
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,514
Yes, I do. No, I don't.
Yes, I do.

105
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,671
No, I don't.
Catch you on the flippity-flop.

106
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,631
This...

107
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,330
call waiting.

108
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,002
You tell the mayor
he just lost six votes.

109
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:06,761
They've been in there a while.

110
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,072
Can't be good.

111
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,693
Think they're talking about me?

112
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:15,168
No, I think
they're talking about me.

113
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:17,093
That makes way more sense.

114
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,941
Okay, thanks, boss.

115
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,272
What is Jim telling him?
That I can't handle this job?

116
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:23,781
That is bull crap.

117
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:26,931
Although it has been chaotic lately.

118
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,645
Corporate shut down
the Buffalo branch,

119
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,373
which left us to absorb
all of their clients.

120
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,342
I will tell you,
there has been work

121
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:36,695
every day.

122
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,092
Had to come in on a Saturday...

123
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,418
to retrieve...

124
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,426
I left my cell phone here.

125
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,014
So jealous of your boobs.

126
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,464
I just wanted to confirm
that you're not coming to the wedding,

127
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,565
which is totally understandable,
and more than fine.

128
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:00,138
Is Ryan going?

129
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,255
I don't know, he hasn't RSVPed yet.

130
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,762
We invited everyone in the office
to our wedding,

131
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,852
even though we realized most people
wouldn't be able to make the drive

132
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:09,327
to Niagara Falls.

133
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:13,017
Which is why we're having it
in Niagara Falls.

134
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,222
Then Michael

135
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:17,669
told everyone they could have
Friday and Monday off

136
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,944
if they came.

137
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,200
So now people have to decide
if they want to come to our wedding

138
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:24,877
or have to work.

139
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,572
Here's the deal.
I really want to go.

140
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:30,639
But I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go,
because it's kind of a waste of time.

141
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,766
That came out wrong.

142
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,311
It'd be awesome if you get him to go,
I'd really like to be there for Jim.

143
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:43,569
What can I do for you, hoss?

144
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,823
- How are your sales doing?
- How are my sales doing?

145
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,647
Busted.

146
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,995
My numbers are down.
A little bit.

147
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,484
It's 'cause of the economy.

148
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:59,009
You're not buying it.
You're good.

149
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:01,392
Okay, the truth is...

150
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:04,779
I have been having trouble
focusing lately. I'm in this weird,

151
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:05,738
flirty,

152
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,022
nebulous

153
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:08,077
thing

154
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:09,952
with this cousin of mine.

155
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,389
And it's a total mind f'er.

156
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,807
Again with the cousin.

157
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:15,564
I'm sorry, Phyllis.

158
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:17,394
You explain this email, okay?

159
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:19,834
"Hey, Andy, let's go visit grandma

160
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,959
"and then get drunk together."

161
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,656
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on in that room.

162
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,589
Wallace had to show up

163
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:31,314
on the one four-month period
that I'm completely overwhelmed.

164
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,386
You know when they say
it's so crazy it just might work?

165
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:40,352
I don't believe that.
I say go for the airtight plan.

166
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,878
And that is why I am having Andy

167
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,426
wheel me into the conference room
inside a makeshift cheese cart.

168
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:47,769
It is

169
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:48,890
just...

170
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:51,064
elegant.

171
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,546
- Be my eyes.
- You got it.

172
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:56,995
What have we here?

173
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,346
Just backing up and turning around.

174
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,730
We're gonna do this...

175
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,107
That's not for you.

176
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:06,166
<i>Pardonnez-moi, monsieur.</i>

177
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:09,122
I took the liberty
of preparing for you

178
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,305
a cheese platter, which I will

179
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,326
place here on the eastern wall
of the conference room.

180
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,703
- Cheese platter?
- <i>Oui, oui, monsieur.</i>

181
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,098
From the Wisconsin region,
a nice, firm cheddar.

182
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:23,032
Also from the great city
of Wisconsin,

183
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:24,511
an aged parmesan.

184
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,881
Here you will find
a cheddar-style spread,

185
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:30,884
which has reacted nicely
with the air

186
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,213
to form a light rind,

187
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:34,555
which I think you'll find
both challenging and delicious.

188
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:37,307
At that point,
I would recommend you take

189
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,893
a quick trip south of the border
to the great state of Illinois,

190
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,020
where you will find
this fine blue cheese dressing.

191
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,645
If I may be so bold,

192
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,090
it's a lot of fun

193
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:47,778
to let the goldfish

194
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,353
take a little swim
in the blue cheese.

195
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:51,732
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

196
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,217
I should go.

197
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:58,704
Thanks for this.
You've given me a lot to think about.

198
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,914
Promise me you won't do anything
until we speak.

199
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:02,387
I won't.

200
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:06,962
- Thanks for taking the time.
- Appreciate it. Thank you, Jim.

201
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,680
- Erin, is Michael around?
- I think... he's around here.

202
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,531
You must have walked right past me.
How you doing?

203
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:26,365
- Could we talk in your office?
- Yes, definitely.

204
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,426
It sounds like a...

205
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:39,952
EMD P40.

206
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:42,746
That's a GE.

207
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:45,000
The P40 is much higher pitched.

208
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,068
- You're into trains?
- I've been my whole life.

209
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:51,715
I'm rebuilding a turn-of-the-century
steam engine in my slaughterhouse.

210
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:53,713
That's so cool.

211
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:55,719
I'd love to take a look.

212
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,536
It's just a slaughterhouse,
but, sure, any time.

213
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:00,641
You know, 'cause of the trains.

214
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,768
- Someone's coming.
- Boy.

215
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,562
It's Darryl! Get down!
He's not using crutches!

216
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,272
Get the camera. Start taping.

217
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,248
- Drive!
- Worker's comp my ass!

218
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:11,923
I can't believe this.

219
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:13,793
You asshole!

220
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,663
You gonna eat
all that dog food yourself?

221
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:23,538
Man! You OK?

222
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:33,382
I just wanted to confirm
that you're not coming to my wedding.

223
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:35,300
Yeah, I might stop by.

224
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:37,986
It costs about $75 per person.

225
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,131
I once had a glass of cognac
that cost $77, so...

226
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,310
Can you just tell me now
if you're coming or not?

227
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,354
I'm coming.

228
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:50,857
- Ryan Howard yes?
- Probably yes.

229
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,800
Kelly Kapoor yes.

230
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:56,280
Are you sure you're okay
with these new responsibilities?

231
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:59,182
- Look who you're talking to.
- Just trying to figure out

232
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:01,790
the best way
to utilize everyone's talents.

233
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,949
I would say that my greatest talent

234
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:07,393
is being the best man,
woman or child

235
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:09,918
- to have ever run this branch.
- And what about Jim?

236
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:13,588
You think Jim is ready to move
into a management position?

237
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,563
- Permission to speak on the record.
- Please, do.

238
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,966
Jim is like...

239
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:25,693
Big Bird.

240
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,011
He is tall

241
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:28,562
and yellow

242
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,090
and very nice.

243
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:32,365
But when I put him in charge, no.

244
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:34,320
I don't think so.

245
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:37,844
Big Bird doesn't make
the tough decisions.

246
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:40,532
If I was going
to put someone in charge,

247
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,499
I would put Bert in charge.

248
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:45,454
Or I would put
one of the real grown-ups, like Maria.

249
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,373
- Or Gordon, maybe.
- I thought you liked Jim.

250
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,125
Very much.
Jim is my best friend.

251
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,335
But...

252
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,412
Here's his performance report.

253
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,698
Right here.

254
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,968
Now, this was written by Toby.

255
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:02,095
Who we all know is extremely...

256
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,382
reliable.

257
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,617
"Constant office distraction.

258
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:07,555
"Spends way too much time
at reception.

259
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,645
"Antagonizes other salesmen.
Not at all what he thinks he is."

260
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:13,940
It's not very well written.
But you get the gist.

261
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,860
Is there anybody else
could run the day-to-day of the branch?

262
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:19,665
I could continue to run it myself,
that's...

263
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,406
Jim had an interesting idea

264
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,535
to help you
with this extra workload.

265
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,322
And it involved
you being promoted to oversee.

266
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:27,947
All Northeast sales.

267
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:30,902
And then Jim would be promoted
to your position.

268
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,295
This was Jim's idea?

269
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:44,238
I'd have to talk to my mother

270
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,221
and my guy at H&R block.

271
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:53,038
Here's the thing, though.
The plan doesn't work

272
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:56,066
unless we have someone to replace you.
I was hoping...

273
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,112
Plus, we have to worry about Jim.
He has another job offer.

274
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,211
We may have to replace him.

275
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:04,491
I didn't tell Michael because...

276
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:06,873
I thought he'd try to help.

277
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:09,527
Example: he handed out jell-o shots

278
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:12,082
at the 23rd mile
of the Steamtown Marathon.

279
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:18,213
- Can you walk me down to my car?
- Sure.

280
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:43,280
I can't help
but feel partially responsible.

281
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:52,938
Little pick-me-up.

282
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,791
Those are the best.

283
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,126
Sugar rush.

284
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,495
 When you were talking to Wallace,

285
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,796
did I come up at all?

286
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:04,134
We did talk
about how handsome you are.

287
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,553
Why don't we head in your office?

288
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:08,932
What did we...

289
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,274
We said...

290
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:13,910
I know
there were certain things we said.

291
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:17,018
I'll just be honest with you.
Earlier today,

292
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:18,931
I spoke with Wallace
about a promotion.

293
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,516
And I actually think
that talk went really well.

294
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,110
Then after he spoke with you,

295
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:25,322
for some reason,
it felt like things had changed.

296
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,119
That's weird.
That's weird.

297
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,285
Kind of weirding me out.

298
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:34,122
Did you know that
Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy?

299
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,124
Did you say anything?

300
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:39,188
Tell you what,
when you leave this office,

301
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:42,923
I'm going to call Wallace and tell him
that you should get that promotion.

302
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:44,193
Really?

303
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,550
You will?

304
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:47,288
Wanna do it right now?

305
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,640
I tried to keep Michael in the dark.

306
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,965
I should have known that he can do

307
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,190
just as much damage in the dark.

308
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,193
I need to see your pupils.
See if they're dilating.

309
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,094
Is that them?

310
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:06,491
Definitely.

311
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:08,657
You come to my house,

312
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,412
bust up my trash cans,

313
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:13,328
Call my baby sister an asshole
and told her to eat dog food?

314
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,288
We thought that she was you.

315
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,423
Why would you think a lady is me?

316
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,433
Are you serious?

317
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:25,340
Because you look exactly alike.

318
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:28,593
Am I the only one?
Are you getting this?

319
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:31,241
- I don't see it.
- Here's what I'm gonna do.

320
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:35,183
I'm calling corporate and I'm filing
a complaint against both of you.

321
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,070
Come on, Gwyneth.

322
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:40,051
Sad.

323
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,946
<i>This is David.</i>

324
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:45,902
David, this is Michael...

325
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:51,259
Just wanted to talk to you
about Jim Halpert.

326
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,582
I understand

327
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:54,974
that he did not receive
that promotion.

328
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:59,194
And I wanted to see what I could do
to nudge you in the right direction.

329
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,210
<i>You're changing your mind about Jim?</i>

330
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,581
Absolutely...

331
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:05,646
not!

332
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,221
Like I said before,

333
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,126
Jim is fantastic,
and he deserves this job.

334
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,651
<i>It seems
like you're cutting in and out.</i>

335
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:16,976
<i>This is not what you said earlier.</i>

336
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:19,676
Here's the thing.

337
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:23,454
Jim is the best man for this job.
I think you should give it to him.

338
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,470
<i>It doesn't change
what you showed me in Jim's file.</i>

339
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:30,572
That was an anomaly.

340
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:32,937
That file had been...

341
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:34,405
falsified.

342
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,995
Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.

343
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,789
<i>I really don't know
what's going on down there.</i>

344
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:41,478
<i>Damn it!</i>

345
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,669
<i>I'm getting pulled over
for talking on my cell. Damn it.</i>

346
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:50,504
Darryl, look,

347
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:53,303
we're here to apologize.

348
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,846
- We're cool.
- Wait.

349
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,752
They're using the lift
as their own personal elevator.

350
00:16:57,877 --> 00:17:00,024
He broke his ankle
climbing over the railing,

351
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,222
he lied about it
'cause it was a misuse

352
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,749
of company equipment.

353
00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:06,775
- Case closed.
- That's stupid.

354
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,699
Really?

355
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:10,820
Then why is there new wood
only on one railing?

356
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:14,116
Let's just check the security tapes.

357
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:18,625
I don't think there's any reason
to check 'em.

358
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,865
But I supposed
if you wanted to be really certain...

359
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,000
All right.
Fine, so whatever.

360
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,591
You really did it.

361
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:29,323
Now I would like
to file an official complaint

362
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,259
to corporate
because Darryl lied on an official form.

363
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,179
I'm telling them
you sexually harassed my sister.

364
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:39,606
No judges gonna believe that.

365
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:46,429
We could all file complaints
against each other,

366
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:48,914
and just drown in a sea of paperwork.
But,

367
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:51,358
we'll just move on with our...

368
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:52,915
with our lives.

369
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,419
So Dwight and Darryl

370
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:58,375
came to an agreement
that they would both file

371
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,464
complaints with corporate,

372
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:02,848
and now I got to do
all this paperwork.

373
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:05,832
We worked it out.

374
00:18:10,534 --> 00:18:13,508
It would make me feel really good
if you would punch me in the face.

375
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:15,617
All right? Just do it.

376
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:18,680
How many times have I asked you
to put me up for a branch manager job?

377
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,715
I never recommended you
because I didn't want to lose you.

378
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,615
And I don't want to lose Pam.

379
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,353
Now I don't want to lose the baby.

380
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,813
Instead, you screwed me?

381
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,518
That's what she said.

382
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,572
- David Wallace is calling.
- I'm in the middle of something.

383
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:35,822
- Should I tell him you'll call back?
- I'll tell him myself.

384
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,512
Let's both.

385
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:48,060
- <i>You got Jim there with you?</i>
- No, it's just us.

386
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,414
<i>Can you call Jim in?
I want him on this.</i>

387
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:51,370
<i>Please.</i>

388
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,072
Here he is right now.

389
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:56,181
Come in.

390
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,895
<i>So I spoke to Alan.</i>

391
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,266
<i>We had kind of an unconventional idea,
which I think is pretty cool.</i>

392
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,915
<i>But it only works
if everyone's on board.</i>

393
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,153
Just as long as it means
Jim becomes a manager.

394
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:19,055
<i>We were thinking of having
two branch managers in Scranton,</i>

395
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,583
<i>Both of you guys
working as co-managers.</i>

396
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,203
<i>Jim would handle the day-to-day,</i>

397
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,331
<i>and, Michael, you would focus
on clients and big picture stuff.</i>

398
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:28,991
- That sounds pretty cool.
- I like that!

399
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:30,794
So manager and co-manager.

400
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,024
<i>Co-manager and co-manager.</i>

401
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:37,063
<i>There are a lot of moving pieces,
and this is the only way I can sell it.</i>

402
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:40,804
That might be a little confusing
because they know me as manager.

403
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,350
<i>Michael,
can you pick up for one second?</i>

404
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,540
<i>Okay, look,
I'm not gonna force you into anything.</i>

405
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,438
<i>If you're willing to lose Jim, fine.</i>

406
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:53,191
<i>You just say so.
We'll find another solution.</i>

407
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,615
<i>Is that what you want to do?</i>

408
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,340
- OK, people, listen up!
- Everybody...

409
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,521
I have an announcement to make.
Fraud was committed...

410
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,542
- You have an announcement?
- I was making it.

411
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,711
Everybody,
David Wallace and I've talked,

412
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,256
And we have decided to promote Jim
to the position of co-manager.

413
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,493
- Co-manager of what?
- Of your butt!

414
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,324
And your butt, and your butt...

415
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:26,399
All of Scranton branch butts.

416
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,169
- What's happening to you, Michael?
- What's happening to me?

417
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,673
I am also being promoted
to co-manager.

418
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,606
We will be co-managers together.

419
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:38,181
Welcome.

420
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,789
Niagara falls in October?
Hells yeah!

421
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:53,293
Do you think that you could
send in your RSVP card?

422
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,461
I'll just tell you now.
Easier.

423
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:57,806
You've to choose a food option,

424
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:00,717
and there's information in there
about directions and lodging.

425
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,182
I'll just have whatever's fanciest,
unless there's ribs,

426
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:05,805
I'll get the other information
the day of. I'll text you.

427
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,623
You're going to text me

428
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:10,602
the morning of my wedding
to ask for directions?

429
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,478
And you will eat
whatever is fanciest?

430
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:14,522
Unless there's ribs.

431
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,625
Rude.

432
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,381
So rude, right?

433
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,708
My gosh.

434
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,007
I have been chasing people down
all day.

435
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:24,073
- It's incredible.
- My bag was there.
