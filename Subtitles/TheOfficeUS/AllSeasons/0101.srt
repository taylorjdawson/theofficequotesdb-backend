1
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:36,044
All right Jim your
quarterlies look very good.

2
00:00:36,184 --> 00:00:38,325
How the thing is
going at the library ?

3
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,508
Oh I told you
couldn’t close it so…

4
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:43,953
So you’ve come to the
master for…guidance ?

5
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,271
Is this what you’re
saying grasshopper?

6
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:48,990
Actually you call
me in here, but yeah.

7
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:51,921
All right, well let me
show you how it’s done.

8
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,742
Yes, I liked to speak to
your office manager please…

9
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:58,338
yes hello this is Michael
Scott, I am the regional manager

10
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:00,243
of dundler Mifflin
paper products.

11
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,425
Just wanted to talk to
you manager à manager.

12
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:09,255
All right done deal,
thank you very much sir,

13
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,039
you’re a gentleman
in the scolar.

14
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:16,958
Oh I’m sorry, ok,
I’m sorry, my mistake.

15
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:24,160
That was a woman I was talking
to... she had a very low voice.

16
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:26,254
Probably a smoker.

17
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,569
So…so that’s the
way it’s done.

18
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:34,985
I’ve been in Dundler
Mifflin for twelve years,

19
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:37,413
the last four as
regional manager

20
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:39,955
If you want to
come through here,

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,022
so we have the
entire floor,

22
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:45,313
so this is my kingdom,
as far as the eye can see,

23
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:48,287
ah this is our
receptionist Pam.

24
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:51,228
Pam, Pam Pam! Pam Beesly.

25
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:53,622
Pam has been with us for…

26
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:55,763
for ever, right Pam?

27
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:57,067
Well, I don’t know!

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,362
If you think
she’s cute now

29
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:00,968
you should have seen her
a couple of years ago!

30
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:01,570
What?

31
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,857
Any messages?

32
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:06,573
Yeah, just a fax

33
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:09,938
Pam this is
from corporate.

34
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:11,594
How many times have I
told you that there’s

35
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:13,801
a special filing cabinet
for things from corporate.

36
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:14,439
You haven’t told me!

37
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,342
It’s called the
wastepaper basket.

38
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:19,885
Look at that !

39
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:22,781
Look at that face!

40
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:24,588
People say I’m
the best boss.

41
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,961
They go, "God we've never worked
in a place like this before,

42
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:32,105
you’re hilarious, and you
get the best out of us.”

43
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,804
I think that pretty
much sums it up

44
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:40,231
I found it at
Spencer Gifts.

45
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:03,029
My job is to
speak to clients

46
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:07,549
on the phone
about quantities

47
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:12,310
and type of copier paper.

48
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:15,802
You know, whether
we can supply to them

49
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:21,440
whether they can
pay for it and...

50
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:27,946
I’m boring myself just
talking about this.

51
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,891
He still loves that
after seven years!

52
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:00,005
What?

53
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:01,709
Nothing

54
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:05,113
Ok, all right.
See you later

55
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,263
All right, take care.

56
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:10,245
Back to work.

57
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:23,364
Corporate really doesn’t interfere
with me at all, Jan Levinson-Gould

58
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,714
Jan, hello!

59
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:28,331
I call her Hillary
Rodham Clinton, right?

60
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,076
Not to her face because,

61
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:34,336
not because I’m scared
of her, because I’m not

62
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:35,597
but...

63
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:36,687
yeah.

64
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:39,524
All right, was it anything you
wanted to add to the agenda?

65
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,441
Me no get an agenda.

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,499
I’m sorry, what?

67
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:46,679
I didn’t get any agenda.

68
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,864
Oh I faxed one
overdue this morning.

69
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:52,921
Really? Cause I didn’t…did
we get a fax this morning?

70
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,924
Yeah, the one…

71
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:58,789
Why isn’t it in my hand?

72
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:01,578
Because a company runs on
efficiency of communication, right?

73
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:06,130
So what’s the problem
Pam, why I didn’t get it?

74
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:10,909
You put it in the garbage can
that was a special filing cabinet.

75
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:19,786
Yeah, that was a joke, that
was actually my brother's,

76
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:23,901
it was supposed to be with bills
and doesn’t work great with faxes.

77
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:24,565
Do you want to
look at mine?

78
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,798
Yeah. Thank you.

79
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:30,519
Ok since the last meeting,
Alan and the board have decided

80
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:33,230
that we can’t justify Scranton
branch and the Stafford branch

81
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:34,585
Oh ok…

82
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:35,793
No, Michael don’t panic

83
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,128
No no no no this is
good, this is fine

84
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,676
Michael listen,
don’t panic

85
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,679
We haven’t made
any decisions yet,

86
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,456
I’ve spoken to Joshua in Stanford
I’ve told him the same as you

87
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:48,752
and it’s up to either you or him to convince
me that your branch can incorporate the other

88
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:49,513
Ok no problem

89
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,583
This does however mean that
there is going to be downsizing

90
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,617
Me no wanna
hear that Jan,

91
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,454
because downsizing
is a bitch,

92
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:58,420
it is a real bitch,

93
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:01,615
and I wouldn’t wish
that on Joshua’s men,

94
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:03,951
I certainly wouldn’t
wish it on my men,

95
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:06,638
or women present
company excluded...sorry.

96
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:10,056
is Josh concerned about
downsizing himself?

97
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:13,852
Not downsizing himself but is
he concerned about downsizing?

98
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:20,955
Question: how long
do we have to …

99
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:26,183
Oh, Todd Paker, terrific
rept, do you mind if I take it?

100
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,873
No, go ahead

101
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:28,738
Pac man!

102
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:30,305
Hey, big queen

103
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,204
Oh, that’s
not appropriate

104
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:34,652
Hey, <?is old gut
zumee ?>coming in today?

105
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,136
I don’t know
what you mean

106
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:39,132
Look, I demanded
ask her one question

107
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:41,144
Does the corporate
master rape

108
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,272
Oh my god!

109
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:49,538
That's so
horrifying! Horrible

110
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,114
Horrible person!

111
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:57,863
So do you think we can keep…a lid on this for
now I don’t want to worry people unnecessarily.

112
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:02,490
No, absolutely. Under this regime,
it will not leave this office.

113
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:06,084
So what is downsizing
actually mean?

114
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:06,874
Well

115
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,989
You guys gotta update your
resume, just like I’m doing.

116
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:13,566
I bet it’s gonna
be me, probably.

117
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,286
Yeah, it’ll be you

118
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:16,722
I have an important
question for you.

119
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:17,343
Yes

120
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,675
Are you going to engelate
<?the cup brains?> on Sunday?

121
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:23,479
Yeah, stop.
That’s ridiculous.

122
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,727
Am I gonna tell them? No I’m not going to
tell them, I don’t see the point of that.

123
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:30,123
As a doctor you would not tell
a patient if they had cancer.

124
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:33,356
This is Mister Scott.

125
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:37,243
Ryan Howard from
the temp agency

126
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:39,323
<?Ted Nickels?> set
me down to start today

127
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:41,796
Howard, like Moe
Howard, Three Stooges?

128
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:52,284
Right here, my vibe. Oh
Pam, that’s a guy thing Pam.

129
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:54,586
I’m sort of a
student in comedy

130
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:07,377
I’m Hitler, Adolph Hitler

131
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,634
I don't think it would be the
worst thing if they let me go.

132
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,235
Because then I might

133
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:19,181
It’s just, I don't think it's many
girls dream to be a receptionist.

134
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,853
I like to do
illustrations,

135
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:27,050
mostly water color,
a few oil pencil.

136
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,339
Jim thinks they’re good.

137
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:32,014
Dundler Mifflin
this is Pam.

138
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:34,917
Sure, Mr. Davis, let
me call you right back.

139
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:38,275
Yeah, some just came up, two
minutes. Thank you very much.

140
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,063
Dwight, what
are you doing?

141
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:40,488
- What?

142
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:41,567
- What are you doing?

143
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:43,745
Just clearing my desk,
I can’t concentrate

144
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:44,855
- It's not on your desk.

145
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:45,628
- It’s overlapping.

146
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,253
It's all coming
over the edge.

147
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:50,622
One word, two
syllables : demarcation.

148
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,267
- You can't do that.

149
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:01,613
- Why not?

150
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:06,415
Safety violation, I could
fall and pierce, and organ.

151
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:08,647
We'll see

152
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,602
This is why the whole downsizing
thing just doesn't bother me.

153
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:17,087
Downsizing?

154
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:22,548
I have no problem with that. I have been
recommending downsizing since Halpert got here

155
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:24,982
even brought it
up on my interview.

156
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:27,917
I say, bring it on!

157
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,823
You just still have messages for
yesterday. Relax everything is under control

158
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:36,695
Yeah, yeah, yeah oh
that’s important, right.

159
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:40,399
Oh, this is so important,
I should run to answer it.

160
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,147
What?

161
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:05,457
Come on. Six million
dollars man, Steve Austin,

162
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,130
actually that would be a good salary for
me don’t you think? Six million dollars?

163
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:12,537
Memo to Jan: I
deserve a raise

164
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,427
Don’t we all?

165
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:15,929
I’m sorry?

166
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,060
There’s nothing!

167
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:23,292
If you are unhappy with your compensation,
maybe you should take it up with HR,

168
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,777
ok? Not today, ok? Pam
just, be professional.

169
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:37,493
I think I’m a role model here, I
think I garner other people respect.

170
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:43,050
Attention on Dundler Mifflin employees, please
we have a meeting in the conference room ASAP

171
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:47,989
People I respect, heros
of mine, would be Bob Hope,

172
00:10:50,694 --> 00:10:54,729
Abraham Lincoln,
definitely,

173
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:58,261
Bono,

174
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:04,047
and probably God
be the fourth one.

175
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:12,913
And I just think all those people
really helped the world, in so many ways,

176
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:18,980
that it’s, it’s
really beyond words.

177
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:22,888
It’s really uncalculable.

178
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:26,531
Now, I know there’s some rumors out
there, and I just kind want to see….

179
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,341
I’m assistant regional
manager, I should know first.

180
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,745
Assistant to the
regional manager.

181
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:32,000
Ok. Can you just
tell me please?

182
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:33,921
Just a whisper in my ear.

183
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:33,921
I’m about to
tell everybody.

184
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,038
I'm just about
to tell exeryone

185
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:37,193
Please, ok.

186
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,159
Do you want me
to tell them?

187
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,008
You don’t know
what it is!

188
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:42,270
Can you tell them,
with my permission?

189
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:43,341
I don’t need your...

190
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:43,905
Permission
granted. Go ahead

191
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:49,636
Corporate has deemed it appropriate
to enforce an ultimatum upon me,

192
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:55,572
and Jan is thinking about downsizing
either the Stanford branch or this branch.

193
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,949
I heard they might be
closing this branch down,

194
00:11:58,146 --> 00:11:59,141
That's just...

195
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:03,191
That's just the rumor going around this
is my first day I don’t really know.

196
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,241
Yeah, but Michael what
if they downsize here?

197
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:06,516
Not gonna happen

198
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:07,858
It could be out of
your hands, Michael

199
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:10,893
It won't be out of
my hands, Stanley, ok?

200
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:11,765
I promise you that.

201
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:12,981
Can you promise that?

202
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,329
On his mother's grave.

203
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:23,047
Well yeah it is a promise, and frankly I’m a little
bit insulted that you have to keep asking about it.

204
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,927
It’s just that
we need to know

205
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:29,528
Hold on a second, I think Pam
wanted to say something, Pam?

206
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:35,156
You had a look that you wanted
to ask a question, just then?

207
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:41,601
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did said
that it could be this branch that gets the axe.

208
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:43,289
Are you sure about that?

209
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:50,233
Pam? Maybe you should stick to the ongoing
confidentiality agreement of meetings.

210
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,666
Pam, information
is power.

211
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:55,770
So you can't say for sure whether
it's gotta to be us or them.

212
00:12:55,795 --> 00:13:00,017
No no, no Stanley, no you did
not see me in there with her.

213
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:07,948
I said, if corporate wants to come in here, and
interfere then they’re gonna have to go through me, right?

214
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:10,215
You know, you can go a
mess with Josh’s people,

215
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,037
but I’m the head
of this family,

216
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:15,726
and you ain’t gonna be
messing with my children.

217
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:28,273
If I left, what would I do with all
this useless information in my head?

218
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:32,218
You know, tonnage
price of minal folders?

219
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,717
Pam’s favorite flavor of
yoghourt, which is mix berry.

220
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:43,293
Jim said mix berries?

221
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,226
Yeah he’s under me

222
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:53,374
Watch out for this guy Dwight
Schrute in the building!

223
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,444
This is Ryan,
the new temp.

224
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:55,715
Nice to meet you.

225
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:57,274
Introduce
yourself, be polite

226
00:13:57,331 --> 00:13:59,271
Dwight Schrute, Assistant
Regional Manager.

227
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,264
Assistant to the
Regional Manager.

228
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:05,996
So Dwight tell him about the kung
fu, and the car and everything.

229
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:11,137
Yeah, I got a 78-2-8 <?daisy?>, I’ve bought her
for 1200, fixed it up, now worth three grand.

230
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,257
That is his profit!

231
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:15,642
New engine, suspension
I’ve got some photos

232
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:18,830
Damn it!

233
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:20,951
Ok, hold on,

234
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,396
Judge is in cession.
What is the problem here?

235
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,466
He put my stuff
in jello again.

236
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,109
That’s rough
professional, thanks

237
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:32,436
That's the third time and it
wasn't funny the first time.

238
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:37,442
It’s ok here, but people some how is
taking advantage because it's so relaxed.

239
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:41,371
I’m a volunteer sheriff's
deputy on the week ends,

240
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,019
and you cannot
screw around there.

241
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:46,471
It's one of the rules.

242
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:47,081
What is that?

243
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:48,085
That’s my stapler.

244
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:50,356
No no no, do
not take it out!

245
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:51,663
You have to eat
it out there,

246
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:53,757
because there are starving
people in the world,

247
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:56,905
and which I hate, and it is
a waste of that kind of food.

248
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:57,950
Ok, you know what?
You can be a witness.

249
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,382
Can you reprimand
him please?

250
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:02,410
- How do you
know it was me?

251
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:03,486
- It's always you.

252
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,763
- Are you gonna
discipline him or not?

253
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:07,130
Ooh discipline, kinky!

254
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:09,852
All right, here’s
the deal you guys

255
00:15:10,046 --> 00:15:14,296
the thing about practical jokes, is that you have
to know when to start, as well as when to stop!

256
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:22,252
And yeah, Jim, now is the time to stop
pulling Dwight’s personal effects into jello.

257
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,081
Ok, Dwight I’m sorry because,
I’ve always been your biggest Flam

258
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:34,888
Nice, that’s the
way it is around here

259
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:38,503
You should have put
him in custard-y!

260
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,327
Yes, new guy!

261
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:43,206
He scores !

262
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:44,863
Ok that’s great, I guess,

263
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:46,657
what I’m most
concerned with is...

264
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:48,556
damage to
company property.

265
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:50,182
That’s all.

266
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:57,067
Pudding…

267
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,719
I’m trying to think,
another desert to do.

268
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,101
Do you like to going out at
the end of a week for a drink?

269
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:06,527
Yeah!

270
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:10,004
Oh, that’s why we all going out, so
we can have an end of the week drink!

271
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,129
well then when
are we going out?

272
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:12,491
I don’t know,
tonight, hopefully.

273
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,157
Ok, yeah.

274
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:17,544
Hey man!

275
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:18,088
Hey!

276
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:18,917
What’s going on?

277
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:19,635
Hey baby!

278
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,094
Roy is my fiancé, we’ve
been engaged about...

279
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:28,930
about 3 years, and we were supposed
to get married in September,

280
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:32,002
but I think we’ll gonna
get married in next spring

281
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:35,774
Do you mind if I go out
for a drink with these guys?

282
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:40,008
No, come on. Let’s get
out of here and go home.

283
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:43,588
Ok, I will be out in a
few minutes so it’s lame

284
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:47,511
twenty past five I’ve
still to do my faxes.

285
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:53,392
You know you
should come with us,

286
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:56,587
because you know we are going out and
it could be a good chance for you to

287
00:16:56,968 --> 00:17:00,101
see what people are like outside
the office, I think it could be fun

288
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:03,905
No, it sounds good but
seriously we gotta get going

289
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:04,504
Yeah

290
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:18,428
What's in the bag?

291
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:20,726
Just tell her i'll
talk to her then

292
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,985
No definitely all right
dude awesome, we’ll do

293
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:32,279
Do I think I’ll be
invited to the wedding?

294
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:42,281
So, have you
felt vibe yet?

295
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:44,006
We work hard,
we play hard.

296
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:46,765
Sometimes we play hard when we
should be working hard, right?

297
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:52,855
I guess the atmosphere that I've
created here is that I am a friend first,

298
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:54,406
and a boss second.

299
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:57,342
Probably an
entertainer third.

300
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,121
Just a second

301
00:17:58,714 --> 00:17:59,425
Right?

302
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:04,816
Oh, hey do you like the
Jamie Kennedy Experiment?

303
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:05,123
Yeah

304
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:06,803
Punk'd, and all
that kind of stuff?

305
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:10,383
You are going to be my complice,
just go on with that ok?

306
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:10,698
All right

307
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:13,111
Just follow my lead,
don’t pimp me all right?

308
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:14,025
Come in!

309
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:17,205
So corporate just said
that I don’t want to…

310
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,542
…you got a fax

311
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:18,595
Oh thank you Pam

312
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,716
Pam? Can you come
in here for a sec?

313
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:25,520
Just have a seat, I was gonna
call you in anyway, you know Ryan?

314
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,450
As you know, there is
going to be downsizing

315
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:35,042
and you have made my
life so much easier,

316
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:39,514
in that I’m going to
have to let you go first

317
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,377
What? Why?

318
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:44,917
Why? Well, theft,
and stealing

319
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,157
Stealing?

320
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,978
What am I suppose
to have stolen?

321
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,659
Post-It notes.

322
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:52,937
Post-It notes...?

323
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,026
Worth of those
like 50 cents?

324
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,765
You steal a thousand Post-It
notes at 50cents a piece,

325
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,309
then you know you’ve
made a profit margin.

326
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,205
Resell of business Pam

327
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,572
- Are you serious?

328
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:08,916
- Yeah.

329
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:12,952
I can’t believe
this, I mean,

330
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:17,231
I have never even stolen as much as
a paper clip and you're firing me.

331
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:20,148
And the best thing
about it is that

332
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:23,317
we are not gonna have to
give you any severance pay,

333
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:27,796
because that is
gross misconduct, and…

334
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:31,021
just clean out your
desk. I’m sorry.

335
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,763
You’ve been X'd punk'd!

336
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,853
Surprise it’s a joke, we
were joking around, you see?

337
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:59,107
Ok, he was in on he
was my accomplice and

338
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:01,850
there was cascand
around booster thing, and

339
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:08,147
we were showing the new guy around the
kind of, to give him the field of place, so…

340
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,399
God, you were, we
totally got you…

341
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:12,773
…you’re a jerk

342
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:16,314
Well, I don’t
know about that

343
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:34,536
What is the most important
thing for a company?

344
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:38,635
Is it the cash flow?
Is it the inventory?

345
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:42,710
No it’s the people.

346
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:44,935
The "people".

347
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:49,869
My proudest moment here was not
when I increased profits by 17%,

348
00:20:50,037 --> 00:20:54,176
or when I cut expenses without
losing a single employee.

349
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:55,554
No, no, no, no.

350
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:58,601
It was a young
Guatemalan guy,

351
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:01,752
a first job in the country,
barely spoke English,

352
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,997
came to me and said

353
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:05,690
"Mr Scott,

354
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:11,548
would you be the
Godfather to my child?"

355
00:21:20,922 --> 00:21:23,807
Didn't work out in the end. We
had to let him go. He sucked.

356
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,107
Hey

357
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:33,198
Hey how are you?

358
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:35,933
Good I thought you were
going out for a drink with…

359
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:37,330
Oh no

360
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,280
How’s your headache?

361
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:43,006
Better, thanks.

362
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:43,565
Good

363
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,533
Are you

364
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:50,300
Walking out?

365
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:51,132
Yes

366
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:53,292
Yes do you wanna?

367
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,233
Yeah

368
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,339
Great, let me just

369
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:57,843
Oh Roy

370
00:21:57,845 --> 00:22:00,166
Yeah, listen have
a nice week-end!

371
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:03,458
Yeah definitely
you too! Enjoy it

372
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,041
Come here

373
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:29,116
The World’s Best Boss
