Question, what kind

That's a ridiculous question.
False. Black bear.

$7 to recreate

Apparently, a disgruntled
employee at the paper mill

34
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,434

she has a good point.

with the last thing you said,

by the time
you explained it...
Okay, okay, okay...

that you guys

00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,516
Why is my girlfriend here?

171
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,949
JIM: Oh, she that teacher
in the white?

172
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,652
No, she's a part-time
frozen yogurt chef.

173
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,154
Which one is she?

174
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,061
The one in the green hoodie.

175
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,321
Wow.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,163
I wonder if she's like
a guidance counselor
or something.

177
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,829
No. I don't think so.

178
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,135
ANDY: She's, like,
probably a tutor...
Nope.

179
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,674
She probably teaches...
No.

180
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,573
There's no...

181
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,343
Okay, press conference in 45.
Dwight, make sure
this place looks nice.

182
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,508
On it.

183
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,548
Okay, Karen, Ryan,
Pam, center stage.

184
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,717
Pam, run a comb
through your hair.

185
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,754
<i>DWIGHT: First rule in roadside</i>
<i>beet sales, put the most</i>
<i>attractive beets on top.</i>

186
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,458
The ones that make you pull
the car over and go, "Wow.

187
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,934
"I need this beet right now."
Those are the money beets.

188
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,834
Hey. Look sharp. Hey. Hi.
Hello, Dwight Schrute.

189
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,539
Hi.
And you must be

190
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,604
from the <i>Washington Post.</i>
<i>Scranton Times.</i>

191
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,411
Chad Lite,
Lighter Side of Life.

192
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,042
And breaking corporate news.

193
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,279
And obits.

194
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:16,915
Oh, dear God.

195
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,581
Okay.
Here are your credentials.

196
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,922
You've been granted
level three
security clearance.

197
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,121
Don't get too excited.
That's out of 20.
Right this way.

198
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,255
Regional Manager Michael Scott
will be addressing the client

199
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,027
in the pressroom shortly.

200
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,192
Have a seat.

201
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,463
Can I get you a beverage?
Yeah, I'd like a...

202
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:32,526
Great.

203
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,136
Oh.

204
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,301
Andy, you know what?

205
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,346
We don't have a lot of time,
so we should probably...

206
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,312
<i>Jamie!</i>
Andy... Oh...

207
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,213
What are you doing here?
Andy?

208
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,683
Are you a student here?

209
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,652
Oh, yeah.

210
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,222
You never told me
you were in high <i>school!</i>

211
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,519
This is weird.
I got to go to Spanish.

212
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,056
Oh, my <i>God!</i>

213
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,697
Oh, my God.

214
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,768
I had no idea.

215
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,007
Well, that's not going
to hold up in court.

216
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,943
We didn't do
anything illegal.

217
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,210
Except knock over a mailbox
with her friends.

218
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,382
Sir... Yes, you have
a valid point...

219
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,580
Okay.

220
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,179
...and I'm sorry.
Yes.

221
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,191
No, I am so sorry.

222
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,385
Really? Dixon City?

223
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,894
I have an aunt in Carbondale.
ANGELA: Excuse me?

224
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,953
Well, I don't see
how that's our fault.

225
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,262
And I've already told you
the official position of
Dunder Mifflin is apologetic,

226
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,598
so I don't know
what you want from me.

227
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:44,776
Okay, first,
I just want to say that
you are doing so good.

228
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,109
Look, you have
so many good qualities,

229
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,480
that the one that
you might want to work on
is apologizing.

230
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,145
When I went over Wednesday
for the spot-check,

231
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,554
I get a call from
Debbie Brown

232
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,718
saying she has
an emergency
dentist appointment.

233
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,658
Emergency dentist appointment?

234
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,527
Now I'm told
she told her manager
she had the flu.

235
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,465
I'm a trusting guy,

236
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,969
but I just wish Debbie Brown
had been there.
We would've caught this.

237
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,830
Yes.

238
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,540
I'll be sure
someone returns your call.

239
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,842
I'm so sorry. Bye.

240
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,075
Hello, I'm looking
for Michael Scott.

241
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,516
Mrs. Allen is
our most important client.

242
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,519
Because every client
is our most important client.

243
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,088
Even though she's a pretty
unimportant client, really.

244
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,395
And so, with the eyes
of the nation upon us,

245
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,024
I would like to say
that Dunder Mifflin

246
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,297
truly regrets
this unfortunate incident.

247
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,700
And as a gesture
of gratitude

248
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,106
for your continued
loyalty, Mrs. Allen,

249
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,436
I would like to present you
with this novelty check

250
00:11:55,514 --> 00:12:00,008
for six months of free paper
or 25 reams,
whichever comes first.

251
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,677
You look good in this.

252
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:08,352
So, let us consider
this matter ended.

253
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:14,028
Well, it isn't ended.
I'm very angry.
I could have lost business.

254
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,326
I know.

255
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,428
I know you are angry
and we are truly, truly sorry.

256
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,131
I don't accept your apology.

257
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,608
The watermark was obscene
and horrifying.

258
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,979
Well, we are extremely sorry.

259
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,571
I don't accept.

260
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,987
I'll be with you in a moment.
All right.

261
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,285
Who was that guy
she was talking to
at her locker?

262
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,855
Not important
because you're not dating her,

263
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,525
because it's a felony.

264
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,798
But who was that guy?

265
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,964
Probably another
high school student.

266
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,875
The issue with the watermark
is very serious.

267
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,969
Absolutely.

268
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,241
We teach our students
that character counts.

269
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,577
And you should.

270
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,576
You don't teach it
well enough.

271
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,848
One of your students
is a bitch.

272
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,688
Know what? Andy is having
a real rough day today.

273
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,227
I want to take out an ad
in your yearbook.

274
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,024
Full page, two words.

275
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,860
"Good luck."

276
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,957
That's not what I had in mind.

277
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,299
Ask where he's from.
MAN: Absolutely.

278
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,837
Where are you from?

279
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,172
Ohio? That's nice.

280
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,797
So what do you want?

281
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,974
He's upset about
the watermark.

282
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,376
Okay, great. Now, just
tell him that it was
an unfortunate error

283
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,574
and we are doing everything
we can do to fix it
and that you're sorry.

284
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,346
It was an unfortunate error.
We're fixing it.

285
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,613
And you already got
your money back.

286
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,949
(WHISPERS)
And you're sorry.

287
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:47,083
And the company has already
apologized, so you can take
that apology or not.

288
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,825
I think he had Tourette's
or <i>something!</i>

289
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,158
We are going to do everything
humanly possible

290
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,168
to ensure that this
never happens again.

291
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,965
Well, it doesn't help.
Why?

292
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,300
Because it already
happened to me.

293
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,897
The watermark,
it's a one-time thing.

294
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,068
I don't <i>care!</i>
It was disgusting.

295
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,702
Cartoon characters
having sex?

296
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,510
May I point out that
the sex appeared
to be consensual?

297
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,346
Both animals were smiling.
Okay.

298
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,318
I grew up on a farm.

299
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,685
I have seen animals having sex
in every position imaginable.

300
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,918
Goat on chicken.
Chicken on goat.

301
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,555
Couple of chickens
doing a goat.
Couple of pigs watching.

302
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,230
Whoever drew this
got it exactly right.

303
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,091
What can I do for you?

304
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,230
All right. For starters,
I think that
you should resign.

305
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,634
(STAMMERS)

306
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,337
Okay. Well, wasn't
really my fault.

307
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,708
The guys at the paper mill...

308
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,542
You're the head...
The guy at the paper mill's...
No, no, no.

309
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,344
You're the head
of the <i>company!</i>
I'm the head of the company?

310
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,781
Yes, and that makes it
your responsibility...

311
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,977
No, I'm a regional <i>manager!</i>

312
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,815
...and so you should
lose your <i>job!</i>
No... What? Okay.

313
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,719
This is insane.
You can get out of here.

314
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,814
Get out. That's insane.
Fine.

315
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,450
I will give this to somebody
who will appreciate it.

316
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,289
DWIGHT: It's non-transferable.
Doesn't matter. Out <i>please!</i>

317
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,522
I'm calling the
Better Business <i>Bureau!</i>

318
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,565
Yeah, well I'm calling
the Ungrateful Biatch <i>Hotline!</i>

319
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,194
Did you get all that?

320
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,532
Everything.

321
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,645
We've gotta do something.

322
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,109
(EXHALES)

323
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,844
This is all spinning
out of control, Pam.
This is just not...

324
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,318
It's just the
<i>Scranton Times.</i>

325
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,685
No, then <i>Newsweek</i>
picks it up

326
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,455
and then CNN does a story
about it and then YouTube
gets a hold of it.

327
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,892
You know what?
I really think the whole thing

328
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,760
is just going to blow over
in like a week or two.

329
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,524
You're right.
It will blow over.

330
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,869
But it's not going to take

331
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,173
a week or two.

332
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,577
Do you know what this is for?

333
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,101
Yes.

334
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,277
Michael likes me to run
the camera when he makes
his apology videos.

335
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,216
He says he needs
a woman's touch.

336
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,428
Okay, I think that's good.

337
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:13,531
Hello, I am Michael Scott,
regional manager of
Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.

338
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,234
By now, you're probably
sick of hearing about

00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,937
and our embarrassing
watermark boner.

340
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,971
MICHAEL:
Let me tell you something.

341
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,639
Something from the heart.

342
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,913
I am not leaving this office.

343
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:32,618
It will take a SWAT team to
remove me from this office
and maybe not even then.

344
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,215
You could never withstand
a SWAT team.

345
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,523
That's how devoted
I am to this job.

346
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,924
DWIGHT: I'm just saying...
I know.

347
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,590
They would flank you,
throw in a concussion grenade.

348
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,395
I understand that, Dwight.
You'd be on the ground...

349
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,402
Do you think
you're taking it a little...
...blind, deaf, dumb.

350
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,994
...literally, Dwight?

351
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,663
If you wanted to be...
And now we're wasting tape.

352
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,071
I'm going to have to
cut this all out.

353
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,369
MICHAEL: Can you say cut...

354
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:51,636
Cut.
...so I'll know where to...

355
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,473
Cut.
I'm asking Pam
to do it, please.

356
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,479
Cut.
Okay. Ready?

357
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,683
Kevin, what's four plus seven?

358
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,175
Eleven.

359
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,484
Yeah, well, you didn't know
that when you filled out
this payroll form.

360
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,185
Yeah? Well, at least
I didn't suck at
customer relations.

361
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,787
Oh, <i>yes!</i> Facial.
Yes.

362
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,195
You two are apes.

363
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,699
I expect you to
apologize for that, Angela.

364
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,034
I'm sorry that
you're both <i>morons!</i>

365
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,663
Oh, but you still said,
"I'm sorry."

366
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,934
I called you morons.

367
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,306
KEVIN: Still said it.
Still said it, so...

368
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,484
Five, four, three...

369
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,150
There is no way I will resign.

370
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,888
It wouldn't be fair.
Not to the good workers
I work with,

371
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,520
not to my clients,

372
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,361
and especially not to me.

373
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:52,871
Let's not forget who this
whole resigning business
is about anyway.

374
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:59,105
If I could leave you
with one thought,
remember, it wasn't me.

375
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,147
They're trying to make me
an escape goat.

376
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,580
If I am fired, I swear to God,

377
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:09,184
that every single piece of
copier paper in this town

378
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,485
is going to have
the F-word on it.

379
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,915
MICHAEL: The F-word.

380
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,327
You have one day.

381
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,255
PAM: One day for what?

382
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,698
That's...
They always give an ultimatum.

383
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,335
Okay.

384
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,235
MICHAEL: Good? Cut?
Cut.

385
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,840
That was your best
apology video ever.

386
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,001
I thought so, too.

387
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,802
I got a farewell card
for Debbie Brown.

388
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,678
I thought maybe you'd like
to sign it. Maybe throw
a couple of bucks in there.

389
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,977
Unfortunately,
she's got some children.

390
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,044
<i>CREED: I feel terrible about</i>
<i>Debbie Brown. She got fired</i>
<i>because of Dwight.</i>

391
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,147
<i>So I thought I'd pass around</i>
<i>a goodbye card.</i>

392
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,419
<i>Maybe everyone could</i>
<i>put in a couple of bucks</i>
<i>to help her through</i>

393
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,189
<i>these difficult times.</i>

394
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,361
<i>Why do bad things always</i>
<i>happen to the good people?</i>

395
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,363
<i>It's tragic.</i>
<i>It is just tragic.</i>

396
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,506
You want music?
I don't care.

397
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,742
Come on, man.
Just give it a couple of days.
I think you'll be all right.

398
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,113
Yeah.

399
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,084

<i>THE LION SLEEPS TONIGHT)</i>

400
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,030
You know what? I don't...

401
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,596
(CONTINUES SCATTING)

402
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,934
(SCATTING

403
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,709
Sweet.

404
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,885
Pam.

405
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,259
Hey, Dwight.

406
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,297
You look really nice today.

407
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,129
I look like an <i>idiot!</i>

408
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,367
Hey, Karen.

409
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,098
Hey, Dwight. Looking sharp.

410
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,369
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm
your boyfriend, Jim Halpert.

411
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,906
Hey, Karen.
Wanna get together later

412
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,505
and have sexual intercourse
'cause you're my girlfriend?

413
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,982
Do you?
No.

414
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,643
Okay.
I'm good. Thanks.

415
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,954
Look at that.

416
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,619
I'm Jim Halpert.

417
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,658
JIM: Spot on.
