00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,646
So, I thought we could
take the customer list

18
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,113
and...

19
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,144
And we could...

20
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,716
You realize
you're not actually
talking to me, right?

21
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,815
And...

22
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,359
Hey, Kelly.

23
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,423
Yes, Charles,
you wanted me.

24

Oh. No, I meant
that Kelly.

25

The new receptionist
is also named Kelly.

26
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,332
So Kelly Kapoor has decided
to hover around my desk

27
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,065
so that she can run
into Charles' office

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,505
every time
he calls for Kelly.

29
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,575
She thinks that if she says
"You wanted me" enough,

30
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,475
he will, in fact,
want her.

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,205
It's not the worst plan
she's ever had.

32
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,742
Oh, and Kelly...

33
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,251
Yes, Charles,
yes, you wanted me.

34
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,585
Okay, I'm going
to call you Kapoor,

35
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,283
okay, and you Hammond.

36
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,793
If we're changing names,
can I be Erin?
It's my middle name.

37
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,954
Erin? Okay,
that's very pretty.

38
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,122
Thanks.

39
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,256
Well, you know what
my middle name is?

40
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,028
Rajnigandha. And I hate it.
I hate it!

It is a coupon

I'm receptionist again.

00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,849
to hire your friends
and they are right.

174
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,621
So, I hired
my best friends.

175
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,592
And this is what I get?

176
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,662
Hey, buddy.
What are you up to?

177
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,099
(CHUCKLES)
Hmm. Nothing.

178
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,531
(WHISPERING) Listen,
when I saw you talking
to Erin earlier,

179
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,040
I noticed that
your pupils dilated
and your skin flushed,

180
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,046
and I'm assuming
a little bit of blood
rushed into your penis.

181
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,778
(SCOFFS)

182
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,915
Well, a little bit of blood
rushed into mine as well,
so where does that leave us?

183
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:56,060
The last thing I want to do
is step on your funk, man.

184
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,996
And I yours,
so I will cede her to you.

185
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,534
No, that's ridiculous.
No, no, no.

186
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,661
Look, you've been here
longer and, besides,

187
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,830
I'm a better wingman
than I am a boyfriend,

188
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,965
so...
But I just want you
and I to hang out.

189
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,702
You know, just...

190
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,303
Boom.

191
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,938
Listen up.

192
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,381
It has come to my attention

193
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,113
that some people
in this office

194
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,786
are not getting along
with other people
in this office.

195
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,295
And I think I have come up
with the reason why.

196
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,661
This office space
is too small.

197
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,292
Definitely.
Okay.

198
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:40,237
There are four corners
in this room.

199
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,873
Each corner is to be
a personal space
for each one of you.

200
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,103
Whichever corner you want,
and make it your own.

201
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,405
We could work from home.

202
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,382
Or you could fire
one of us.

203
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,882
Whoever has
less education.

204
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,079
Okay, guys,
thank you for the offers,

205
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,054
but I want you to get pumped
about this corner idea.

206
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,422
All right, one, two, three,
what are we going to do?

207
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,818
Corner idea.
No, you're supposed to say,

208
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,328
"Rock the house."
Rock the house.

209
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,489
How would we know that?

210
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,231
Hey, dude, do you know
what a rundown is?

211
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,034
Use it in a sentence.

212
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,196
Uh...

213
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,638
Can you get this
rundown for me?

214
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,175
Try another sentence.

215
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,972
This rundown better
be really good.

216
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,308
I don't know, but it
sounds like the rundown
is really important.

217
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,541
Charles asked me
to do this rundown
of all my clients.

218
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,174
Why don't you just
ask him what it...

219
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,219
No, I can't,
that was like hours ago.

220
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,878
What have you been doing?

221
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,785
Try another sentence.

222
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,621
RYAN: Last night
was crazy.

223
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,918
Jojo? Yeah.

224
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,793
He did a doughnut
in the parking lot
in front of a cop.

225
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,354
Then he yells, "Hey, cop,
you like doughnuts?"

226
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,025
And we drive off.

227
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,126
No, he just
stayed there.

228
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,835
I want that new phone.

229
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,101
No, the other one.

230
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,373
No, the other one.
No, you know which one
I'm talking about.

231
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,968
It's the one...

232
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,538
(SIGHS)
No, the one with
the awesome browser.

233
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,205
(TOILET FLUSHING)
No, not that one.

234
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,042
That's my corner.

235
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,677
I thought that
was your corner.

236
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,982
No, this is where I work.

237
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,657
I can't relax in the
same corner where I work.

238
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,126
So my corner's the one
with the copier?

239
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,963
Pam, I don't make
the rules.

240
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,897
RYAN: I wish my iPod
could make phone calls.

241
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,802
No, I don't want an iPhone.
I know what an iPhone is.

242
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,039
You started on that
rundown yet?

243
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,714
Oh, this is just something
I'm taking a break with.
Oh.

244
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,519
I will get back to
the rundown right now.

245
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,455
Okay, great.
Hey, you know what?

246
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,085
Do you have a rundown
that I could take a look at,

247
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,528
just so I know
what type of rundown
you're looking for?

248
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,589
Just keep it simple.
Keeping it simple,
that's what I'm doing.

249
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,293
But I am working
hard on this one.

250
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,666
Real hard, so...
You're working hard? On this?

251
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,507
No, not too hard,
not harder than I should.

252
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,240
Right, I mean,
why work harder
than you should?

253
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,641
(CHUCKLES)

254
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,974
No, I...

255
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,353
Can I help you?
No, thanks.

256
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,887
Hey.
Hey, I'm here
to see Charles.

257
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,082
Okay.

258
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,592
Hey, Charles.
Hey, Pam.

259
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,356
I know you're a very
busy man, so I'll cut
right to the chase.

260
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,795
Okay.
I'd like my old job back.

261
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,933
I don't know what to tell you.
The job's been taken.

262
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,134
Well, I could come
back as a salesman.
I have experience now.

263
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,409
Or I could come back
as your personal assistant.

264
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,410
You know, sort your mail,
set your appointments.

265
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,538
I know all the people.
Yeah, no.

266
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,615
Personal shopper?

267
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,809
No.

268
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,344
Well, it was great
catching up with you,

269
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,581
and I'll see you
around the building.

270
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,680
Okay.

271
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,389
I'm just going to sit here
for a little bit longer
if that's okay.

272
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,287
The air smells so good.

273
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,091
I don't remember it
smelling so good.

274
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,960
Chairs are so comfortable.

275
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,829
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

276
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,875
Oh, hey, Stanley,
Phyllis, come on in.

277
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,677
Welcome, welcome.
Let me give you the tour.

278
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,140
I get it.
You need to see more?

279
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,378
It's really cute.

280
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,215
Thank you.
Do you remember Ryan?

281
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,454
(LAUGHING)

282
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,321
And Pam,
around here somewhere.

283
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,493
She's upstairs
talking to Charles.

284
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,889
What for?
I don't know.

285
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,492
Are we staying
until 5:00?

286
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:30,958
Yes.

287
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,940
Maybe the Michael Scott
Paper Company was
a huge mistake.

288
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,676
I should leave.
I should go

289
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,147
and start my own
paper company.
That'll show them.

290
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,588
Get your free pancakes.

291
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,216
They are delicious.
They are nutritious.

292
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,854
They are complimentary.

293
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,761
Young sir, would you
like a free pancake?

294
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,527
I'm texting.
I don't want to get
my hands sticky.

295
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,001
Ryan, enough with
the texting machine.
Come on.

296
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,401
Tuck in your shirt.
You're the face
of this company.

297
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,175
Hey, Pam.
Hey.

298
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,338
You sort of disappeared
there for a while.
Where you been?

299
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,677
Yeah, I needed to
take care of some stuff.
Yeah?

300
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,445
That's as specific
as I'd like to be.

301
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,413
Well, at least
you're still being
honest with me.

302
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,922
There's the rundown
you asked for.

303
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,155
I may have expanded
some areas that you
werert prepared for...

304
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,858
Great, fax that to everyone
on the distribution list.

305
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,124
Uh, sure.

306
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,600
Do you want to
look at it first?
Do I need to?

307
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,867
No. No, I just...

308
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,841
Wanted to make sure
we have the same format.

309
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,713
So that distribution list
is going to be my...

310
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,876
What's that?
The one I have.
I'll use the one I have.

311
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:02,557
Just faxing my dad a rundown.

312
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,991
We're small, but we're eager
to make a name for ourselves.

313
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,429
Do you have a card?

314
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,532
No, I don't have a card,
but I'll do you one better.

315
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,732
A little scrap of paper.

316
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,298
(LAUGHING)

317
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,438
These are terrible, boss.

318
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,242
You got to make them
in a circle, so that
they cook evenly.

319
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,612
They're shaped
like paper.

320
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,480
Well, I don't even
want these.

321
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,521
I'll take them
for my kid.

322

(VOCALIZING)

323
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:45,029
(SINGING) Country roads,
take me home

324
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,537
To the place...

325
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,199
Sorry, I like that song.
You're good.

326
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,308
You're good.
Thank you.

327
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,902
That was great,
but it's just sort of...

328
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,573
It's still a little choppy,
like... But don't worry,
it's hard, I mean,

329
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,115
it took me a while, too.
It's like...

330
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,549
Wow.

331
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:07,981
What?

332
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,186
Oh, my God,
you heard that?
I'm so embarrassed.

333
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,594
I'm so, like, rusty.
It's good, you're
really coming along.

334
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,029
It's really technically
proficient,

335
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,294
but, you know,
there's really no heart
or soul in it.

336
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,562
Really?

337
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,546
Hey, do you want
to sing it with me?

00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,051
In German!

342
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,856
(SINGING IN GERMAN)

343
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,766
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads

344
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,238
To the place I belong
To the place I belong

345
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:03,441
West Virginia, mountain momma
West Virginia, mountain momma

346
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:07,481
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads

347
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,043
Take it, Andy!

348
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,619
Take me home to the place

349
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,924
You have to stop.

350
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,344
I once had a dream

351
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:37,407
that I was eating
a peanut butter and
tuna fish sandwich,

352
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,443
and let me
tell you something,
it was delicious.

353
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,182
So, the next day,
I decided to make
that sandwich.

354
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,218
And in real life
it is disgusting.

355
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,486
(PHONE RINGING)

356
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,050
It is a disgusting sandwich.

357
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,127
And the reason
I tell you this story...

358
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,358
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)

359
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,060
Pick up the phone. Just...

360
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,903
Dunder... Michael Scott
Paper Company, this is Pam.

361
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,541
Oh. Hi, Russell from
the pancake luncheon,
how are you?

362
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,844
Well, we'd like to do
business with you, too.

363
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,009
How can I make that happen?

364
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,313
Keep going.
Tell him we have
free delivery.

365
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,685
We already offer
free delivery.

366
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,246
They don't know that.

367
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,723
I can offer you
free delivery on any order
that you place today.

368
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:24,853
God.

369
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:30,234
(SHUSHING)
Okay, 20 boxes, I can do...
Just a second.

370
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,464
I can do 20 boxes
at $43 a box.

371
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,469
Great.

372
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,305
Write it down.

373
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,470
Give him a guarantee.

374
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,377
A guarantee of what?
Just say the word.

375
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:46,941
And I guarantee that
you will be satisfied,

376
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,086
because your satisfaction
is our guarantee.

377
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,848
We guarantee it.

378
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,525
We look forward
to doing business
with you, too.

379
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,618
Thank you, Russell.

380
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,326
Yes!
I made a sale!

381
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,365
You did! Oh, yeah!
Oh, my God.

382
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,532
We did it!
She did it! Yeah!

383
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,931
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

384
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,732
Who would have thought
that the thing that

385
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,740
would save this company
would be work?

386
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:10,797
And pancakes.

387
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,810
In the end,
this day definitely
had its ups and downs.

388
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,941
I realize that we don't
have the biggest office,

389
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:23,113
which is a surprise,
because 165 square feet
sounds like a lot.

390
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,886
But we have people
with the biggest hearts,

391
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,189
and I think
for a small company,

392
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,485
that is really...

393
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,961
(TOILET FLUSHING)

394
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,527
Someone went
to the bathroom.

395
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,701
That is really
what's important.

396
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,373
Literally every song
is better a cappella.
Name a song.

397
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,275
Cherry Pie, Warrant.
Better a cappella.

398
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,780
No, really?
Yeah, name another.

399
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,107
Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Better a cappella.

400
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,951
Rebel Yell, Billy Idol.

401
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,817
(EXCLAIMING)
Way better a cappella.

402
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,549
Really?
Yeah.
