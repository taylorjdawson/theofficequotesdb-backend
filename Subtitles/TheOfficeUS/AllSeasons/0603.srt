1
00:00:01,946 --> 00:00:04,636
- Could you sign my expense report?
- No way, no how.

2
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:07,873
Expense reports are a day-to-day item.
That is Jim's now.

3
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:10,676
I am exclusively big picture, epic.

4
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:20,047
Sign this.

5
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:23,189
Where's the "please"?
We're not animals.

6
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:24,106
Sign it.

7
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:25,775
Not without a "please."

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,027
Idiot.

9
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:35,531
- I have a complaint about Jim.
- That is not big picture.

10
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:38,838
I would like to file a huge,

11
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:41,285
enormous, massive complaint

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,335
about the tallest guy in our office.

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,177
Jim won't sign my expense report.

14
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:55,428
That is not... Okay...

15
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,515
- That is day-to-day.
- No, that his huge.

16
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,683
You're trying to trick me.
Get out, get out, get out...

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,179
- I'd like to lodge a complaint.
- I'm sorry to hear about that.

18
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:09,068
- Who is this about?
- You!

19
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,957
Just want to let you know
I take complaints very seriously.

20
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:16,492
- When did this happen?
- One minute ago.

21
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:19,116
- And how do you feel?
- Angry.

22
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:21,288
- All right. Did he hit you?
- No.

23
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,970
- Did you cry?
- No.

24
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:24,834
- Did you feel like crying?
- No.

25
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,752
I'm gonna write, "held back tears."

26
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:29,422
Wait, stop writing that.
That is not true.

27
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,730
If you stop crying,
I'll stop writing it.

28
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,427
I deserved that promotion, not Jim.

29
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,826
Makes me want to put him
in a triangle choke hold

30
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:44,671
and force him down to the ground
and just keep pressing and pressing.

31
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,336
And then flip him over
and then put him in a hammer lock.

32
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:51,389
And he's gasping, he's panting.
Every last breath.

33
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:53,311
And the crowd is going crazy.

34
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,791
I emerge victorious!

35
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,869
$18,000 and a chance at the title.

36
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,711
Jim wants you to keep it down.

46
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:41,258
Everyone, now would be
a good time to freshen up,

47
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:44,378
because I'd like everyone to meet
in the conference room in five minutes.

48
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:46,978
I suggest that you bring a snack,
we may be in there for a while.

49
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:49,668
Can I talk to you in my office?

50
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,213
Sure, but could I first
talk to you in my office?

51
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,780
Can I also be a boss?

52
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,062
It doesn't take a genius to know
that any organization thrives

53
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:02,887
when it has two leaders.

54
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:06,343
Go ahead, name a country
that doesn't have two presidents.

55
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,998
A boat that sets sail
without two captains.

56
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:10,606
Where would catholicism be

57
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,893
without the popes?

58
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:13,628
I have noticed that...

59
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:14,596
Welcome.

60
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:18,916
I've noticed we've been having
a lot of conference room meetings.

61
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,941
And I'm wondering
if perhaps those are a bit...

62
00:03:22,396 --> 00:03:23,446
Disruptive.

63
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,622
I don't think they are.

64
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,040
I think
the meetings are very important.

65
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:30,042
Maybe we should talk specifics.

66
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:31,358
Let's do.

67
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,255
Yesterday, we had a meeting
about planets.

68
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,778
Well, to be fair, Jim...

69
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,402
James...

70
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,001
Jimothy...

71
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,077
To be fair, Jimothy, the...

72
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:44,598
That sounds weird.
Are you okay with being called Jim?

73
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,512
I am.

74
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:49,452
Jim, to be fair,
the conversation wasn't about planets.

75
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:53,605
At first, we were talking about
introducing a line of toilet paper.

76
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:56,944
And what part of the human body
does one use toilet paper upon?

77
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,184
So you draw a line from there
to the other planets,

78
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:04,577
and I think by the end, we all learned
a little bit about how small we are.

79
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,219
- Yes, I agree...
- Because it's a big universe,

80
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:10,291
and we're all just little,
tiny specks of dust.

81
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:14,026
I just think that maybe
they're eating large amounts of the day.

82
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,379
You know what eats
a large amount of the day are naps.

83
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:18,663
You go to sleep, it's light out,
you wake up, it's dark.

84
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:21,362
That's the whole day.
Where did that day go?

85
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:22,737
I have no idea.

86
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,943
You mean on a weekend.

87
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:30,363
I think our goal should be

88
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:33,814
we don't have meetings
unless they're absolutely essential.

89
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:36,850
- No more meetings this week.
- Really?

90
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,486
- You just agree to that?
- I can be very surprising.

91
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,370
What's going on?

92
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:50,973
I need to fit into my wedding dress.

93
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:53,603
However, I'm also pregnant.

94
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,883
It's a myth that women have to gain
more than nine pounds in a pregnancy?

95
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,093
Look at these actresses.
Some of them lose weight.

96
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:07,973
Did you guys register
for wedding gifts?

97
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,042
We did,
but mostly because people expect us to.

98
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:14,229
We're also accepting other gifts...

99
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,997
not on the registry...

100
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:18,914
However much.

101
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:23,062
It's awkward asking people for money,
but we could really use it.

102
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:26,306
Why doesn't Crate & Barrel
let you register

103
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:28,518
for a toaster full of cash?

104
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,621
Perfect. I hate registries.

105
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:31,705
Good.

106
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:35,208
My cousin makes the most amazing,
romantic birdhouse mailboxes.

107
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,629
I know I shouldn't tell you,
but you'll still be surprised.

108
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:40,797
You're not registered
for a birdhouse?

109
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,716
No, we're not.

110
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:43,819
Good.

111
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:54,555
Okay,
I thought I saw people missing.

112
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,398
Just focus-grouping
a product expansion idea to these folks.

113
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,441
- Got one of each.
- Really?

114
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,611
Stanley, what was the last thing
Michael said before I came?

115
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,316
You don't need to answer that.

116
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,391
"If you don't smell this,
you're fired."

117
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:10,494
I thought we agreed to not take up
people's time with meetings like these.

118
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,110
What do you mean by "these people"?

119
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,000
This is a conference room meeting.

120
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,369
Everybody,
I think that Jim has gone insane,

121
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:21,338
because he thinks
that my office is a conference room.

122
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,965
That's not what I meant.

123
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,469
No offense,
but when push comes to shove,

124
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,178
what I want is more important
than what you want.

125
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,180
- I disagree.
- What do you guys think?

126
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,066
Can I go back to my desk now?

127
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,309
Great. Guys, can I just have
a moment with Michael?

128
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,519
You don't need to go anywhere.
Anything that Jim has to say to me,

129
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:39,898
he can say
in front of these types of people.

130
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,754
That is not what I said,

131
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,391
and, also, I am co-manager,

132
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:46,780
meaning you are not the only manager.
I am also a co-manager.

133
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,325
- That's not what Wallace told.
- That's exactly what he told.

134
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,274
That is not the way I heard it.

135
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,123
I love rivalries...

136
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:56,098
Michael or Jim,
Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C.

137
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,510
It's so much fun.

138
00:06:57,956 --> 00:06:59,923
But I guess
if I'm really thinking about it

139
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:01,914
and answering
your question honestly,

140
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,474
I'd have to go with L.C.

141
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,449
Heidi's a bad friend,
and her skin is terrible.

142
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:09,430
It is one thing,
me giving you the co-manager title.

143
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,972
It is another thing,
you bossing me around.

144
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,814
I'm not. I'm trying to do my job,

145
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:17,144
which is sharing your job,
so maybe we should just call David.

146
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:20,631
No, we will not call David Wallace.
I will call David Wallace.

147
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,920
David Wallace
is on line two for you guys.

148
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:25,277
Or Davidwill call us on line two.
Why don't we just...

149
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:27,946
Hey, David.
You got Jim here.

150
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,994
This is Michael, senior co-manager.

151
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,119
<i>Hey, guys,</i>

152
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:34,603
<i>I'm calling, because, unfortunately,</i>

153
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:37,818
<i>we will not be able
to give out cost of living raises</i>

154
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:39,750
<i>this year,
and I know people expect it.</i>

155
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,879
<i>However, there just is only
a small amount of money for each branch,</i>

156
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,288
<i>so we're leaving it up to the managers
to decide how to distribute it.</i>

157
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:48,515
Got it, Dave.

158
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,490
Sounds like
your classic big-picture decision.

159
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,308
Which will clearly affect
the day-to-day well-being of employees.

160
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,845
- <i>It's probably a little of both.</i>
- Which is it more of?

161
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,935
<i>Excuse me?</i>

162
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,215
I know that I'm very new at this,
but I have a very good perspective.

163
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:03,281
<i>Wait, I'm sorry.
Michael, are you...</i>

164
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:04,650
<i>Are you texting me?</i>

165
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,250
I thought maybe
we could talk after this is over.

166
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,422
<i>Look, I need you both
to take care of this.</i>

167
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:12,692
<i>This is not going to be
a problem, is it?</i>

168
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:14,952
- Nope, not at all.
- No, it will not be.

169
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,160
I am on top of it.

170
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:18,288
- Thanks a lot.
- Talk to you later.

171
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,506
You didn't let me say good-bye.

172
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,044
All right,
I am looking forward to this.

173
00:08:24,673 --> 00:08:27,381
- You don't have to lie.
- I hate that we have to do this.

174
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:29,938
I think
we work much better separately.

175
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:33,679
When I am irritated and I look at you,
I don't see you anymore.

176
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:35,639
All I can see

177
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,723
is how big and gross
the pores on your nose are.

178
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:38,982
All right.

179
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:40,310
Let's get started.

180
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:48,854
Hey, why haven't we ever...

181
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,238
We have.

182
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,236
There's no easy way to do this.
I say...

183
00:08:57,361 --> 00:09:01,039
we add 1.5% to their paychecks
and don't say anything about it.

184
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,572
Like break in
in the middle of the night

185
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:06,428
- and change the numbers on payroll?
- We can do it during the day.

186
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:08,172
It doesn't have to be that dramatic.

187
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:11,530
You know what would help is

188
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:13,927
a pros and cons list
for our options.

189
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,014
Don't take this the wrong way.
Are you gonna take this the wrong way?

190
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:20,434
- It's hard to tell so far.
- You use your brain too much.

191
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,352
Are you advocating
that I use it less?

192
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,522
Sometimes the smartest people
don't think at all.

193
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,192
- You just came up with that.
- As I was saying it.

194
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:32,048
Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro:

195
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:33,489
everyone gets a little bit.

196
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,324
Con: you look like a nerd.

197
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,118
Con: no one gets
as much as they did last year.

198
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,481
Pro: you get to share your list
with the other nerds.

199
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:43,456
Pro: no favoritism.

200
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,727
Con: you unzip your pants,

201
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,253
and you find
that there's a calculator down there.

202
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:51,465
I've been studying Michael
for years,

203
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,636
and I've condensed
what I've learned into this chart.

204
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,345
How Michael spends his time.

205
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,230
As you can see, we have
procrastinating and distracting others,

206
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:02,255
and this tiny sliver here
is critical thinking.

207
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:05,851
I made it bigger,
so that you could see it.

208
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:12,528
I heard that you were registered,
but I didn't hear where.

209
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:15,679
I don't think
we registered anywhere.

210
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:18,387
We just want cash.

211
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:19,889
Like money?

212
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:22,996
You want my money?

213
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,041
Will you take a check?

214
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:28,813
Cool.

215
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:33,924
In the memo line, I'm gonna write,

216
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,510
"To love's eternal glory. "

217
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,305
Wait till Monday.

218
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,236
Is this what I've become?

219
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:45,103
Materialistic?

220
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:46,621
Shallow?

221
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:48,797
I feel horrible.

222
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:50,653
Look!

223
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,410
"Mrs. Pam Halpert!"

224
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:56,165
That's the first time
I've seen it in writing.

225
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,490
You know, the more I think about it,
the more I think,

226
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:02,348
we should give it to the salesmen.

227
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:05,457
- That will not go over well.
- I know. I just think it seems smart

228
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,198
to keep the salesmen happy.

229
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:09,575
Of course I know
that this might come off as biased,

230
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,129
so you know what?
Let us...

231
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,584
Are you gonna make
another pro and con list?

232
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:17,009
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- I'm not gonna stop thinking.

233
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:18,960
I could not do that, Jim.

234
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,178
I can see it
in your crusty little eyes

235
00:11:21,303 --> 00:11:23,439
that you are going to make
everything perfect.

236
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:25,714
If I can just think this through,

237
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:28,661
if I could just think it
exactly right,

238
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,111
I can make this perfect.

239
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,713
Then I can go down every avenue,

240
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:35,444
every avenue off of that avenue,

241
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:37,567
and then another avenue.

242
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,865
- And then another...
- You've a lot of strengths.

243
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,774
I do? Tell me what they are.

244
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,576
I think that you are able

245
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,954
to take constructive criticism
very well.

246
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,874
That...
I am not known for that.

247
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,667
There is a reason why I'm here.

248
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,919
You went over my head to Wallace.

249
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,255
It's because you also have
a lot of weaknesses.

250
00:11:56,184 --> 00:12:00,177
Why don't you tell me what those are?
Why don't you enliven me?

251
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,346
You're not good
at making tough decisions.

252
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,697
At thinking out the options,

253
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,866
and then stating that decision
very clearly,

254
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:08,769
especially when
it's an unpopular decision.

255
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,670
Here's a tough decision for you.

256
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,830
You suck. You suck.
Is that clear enough for you?

257
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,128
Maybe,

258
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,047
I'm here for a reason,

259
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:19,112
because I might have
some good ideas, too.

260
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,490
I've been sitting out there,
learning a lot,

261
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,416
and maybe I can just bring something

262
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,785
different to the table.

263
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,260
OK, Skippy, here we go.

264
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:29,281
Why don't you run yourself
out there and tell them?

265
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:31,484
You call it.

266
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,346
This had better be terrible.

267
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,107
Could I have everyone's attention?
I have some tough news,

268
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:44,285
so I'm gonna give it
to you straight.

269
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,143
Truth is, we only have
so much money for raises this year,

270
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:50,227
so the simple fact is some people
will get raises and some people won't.

271
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:52,229
Now, what we've decided is,

272
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,856
we are gonna give those raises
to the sales staff.

273
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:56,525
Wait. Seriously?

274
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,629
You guys are smart,
so I'm just leveling with you.

275
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:02,489
- I'm trying to treat you like adults.
- Thank you, Jim, for...

276
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:04,658
thinking that we're smart people.

277
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,492
But I do not understand.

278
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:09,579
If we're such smart adults,
then why don't we get raises?

279
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:13,262
Excellent question, genius.
'Cause Jim wants to give the raises

280
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:15,210
to his friends
and the people he sleeps with.

281
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,426
Easy. That's not it at all.

282
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:20,789
Really what it is is about the money
the sales staff brings into the office.

283
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:23,050
- What's going on?
- Jim is only giving raises

284
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:24,415
to the salesmen.

285
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,222
- Why are you being such a jerk?
- Hold on, kelly.

286
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,203
Would it help you to know
that Jim thinks you're smart?

287
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,794
How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?

288
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,230
This is ridiculous!
How could he do this to us?

289
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,607
You know what?
You'd be getting the raise...

290
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:40,360
What about all these people?
How is it fair to them?

291
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:44,925
We work as hard as the sales people.
We deserve raises.

292
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,222
They don't get 'em
if we don't get 'em.

293
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:48,927
My kid needs shoes!

294
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:51,337
You want to tell him
he doesn't get shoes?

295
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,081
Her kid needs shoes, Jim!

296
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:54,582
What the hell?

297
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,328
I'm just gonna

298
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:00,626
rewind

299
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:03,034
and back off a bit.

300
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:12,714
That was good.

301
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:13,982
That was good.

302
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:15,154
Okay, all right.

303
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,731
Well, we all know
it's hard to be a boss, right?

304
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:20,150
You know what?
Look around you.

305
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,367
These are your best friends.

306
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:23,992
These are the people

307
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:27,157
who will open their hearts to you.

308
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,992
They all have

309
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:31,453
heart-ons for you,

310
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:33,628
and that is a gift.

311
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:35,781
So in terms of gifts,

312
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:37,814
we should be giving
each other gifts.

313
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:41,296
Angela, yes,
lend Oscar a cup of sugar.

314
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,215
What are you talking about?

315
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,765
We just need to hear
your plan for our raise.

316
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,718
My plan...

317
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:49,812
A man... Panama.

318
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:53,725
- That's not how that goes.
- You're not saying anything.

319
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,268
At least, Jim was direct

320
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,562
when he was telling us
his dumbass plan.

321
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,209
What's happening?

322
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:01,691
Are we getting a raise, yes or no?

323
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,985
Let me get this clear.
Does everybody want a raise?

324
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:06,937
All right, everyone wants a raise.

325
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:09,748
What we're going to do
is go into here,

326
00:15:09,873 --> 00:15:11,827
and we will not come out
until we do.

327
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:13,828
That gives us no information.

328
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,996
This isn't a game, you know?
It's our livelihood!

329
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,085
What about a raise based on merit?

330
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,266
Rank each person individually.

331
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:25,769
Piece of cake.

332
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,482
- Ryan, obviously the best.
- Well, obviously.

333
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,797
Too bad he's a temp, he doesn't count.
Let's get started.

334
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:32,438
Are you making a...

335
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:34,263
I'm numbering the paper.

336
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,041
- Just...
- I don't understand

337
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,971
how they can even consider

338
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:40,926
giving money to some people
and not the rest of us.

339
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:42,715
We're not gonna see the checks.

340
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,251
- We're in accounting.
- I am so pissed at this company.

341
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:46,376
And Jim.

342
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:48,988
Who said that?

343
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:50,850
I think it was Creed.

344
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:58,218
It's going really well, actually.

345
00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:01,072
Each Boston Baked Bean
represents half a percent raise,

346
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:04,254
we each got 24 beans,
so the idea is you place the bean

347
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:07,348
on the picture of
who you think deserv...

348
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:08,397
Who's that?

349
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:12,053
- He's not a part of this.
- Just wanted to draw a picture of him.

350
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:15,789
- Your move.
- All right, who to pick?

351
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,772
- Who to pick?
- Here we go.

352
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:20,182
I...

353
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,647
will skip a turn.

354
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,233
You're gonna still have
to play that bean.

355
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,659
I need more time.

356
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:36,995
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting.
He wants you both to respond.

357
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,742
People are starting
to notice how terrible Jim is.

358
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,263
It's great.

359
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,756
Eventually,
they'll rise up and revolt.

360
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:04,852
My only hope is that
they do it sooner rather than later.

361
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:07,027
If the people here
were our founding fathers,

362
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,974
the Revolutionary War
would have been delayed ten years,

363
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,571
because Stanley Washington
was napping,

364
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:17,288
Phyllis Hancock
was still signing the declaration,

365
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:21,480
Kevin Jefferson
was distracted by a butterfly.

366
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,008
Come on in.

367
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:24,786
That's right.

368
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,252
Come in, feast your eyes.

369
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:28,520
They determine our worth

370
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,190
by putting beans upon our faces.

371
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,803
Things were not this bad
when just Michael was manager.

372
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,196
- What are you doing?
- What does a bean mean?

373
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:38,723
Why aren't there any beans

374
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,741
on this very old,
frizzy-haired picture of me?

375
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:43,688
What does a bean mean?

376
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:48,149
- I was trying to be unbiased.
- What does a bean mean?

377
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,287
- Please explain it to Kevin.
- Why can't you?

378
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:53,615
- My time is valuable as yours.
- Not according to the beans.

379
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
This is how you make
this important decision?

380
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,400
There's no way

381
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,472
that Stanley gets more beans than me.
That is ridiculous.

382
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:03,271
This is how it works.

383
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,709
It's not so much
that I might not get a raise.

384
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,047
It's just demeaning.

385
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:09,404
Thank you.
That is exactly...

386
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,322
By the way,
I would also like a raise.

387
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:13,669
I would, too.

388
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:15,414
Are we idiots?

389
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:21,065
What right
does Jim have to claim authority?

390
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:23,727
Is he as good a salesman as I?

391
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:25,013
Is he as

392
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,771
matronly as Phyllis?

393
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:30,724
There are moments
where we can affect change.

394
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,941
For a few seconds, every decade,

395
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:35,960
we exist,

396
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,993
and these are those seconds.
Let us storm his castle.

397
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,660
Come on... Tick.

398
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:43,812
Let's get him... Tock.

399
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,835
Let's get Jim!

400
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:46,991
Tick.

401
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:49,533
And drag Jim out of his office...
Tock.

402
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:51,087
Take his keys away from him.

403
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,089
Tick... That's a clock.

404
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,008
The time is getting very close.

405
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,426
It's now or never.

406
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,858
What say you?

407
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:00,513
I say no.

408
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,224
No, I mean,
what do you say to my plan?

409
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,516
What does a bean mean?

410
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:19,200
How you doing?

411
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:22,711
On a scale of one to ten,
I'd say I'm about a four.

412
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,782
What are you usually?

413
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:25,750
Six.

414
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,623
You?

415
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:29,463
Usually a ten,
but I'm feeling like a zero.

416
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,879
A performance-based raise
sounded like a good idea, right?

417
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,547
I know, I know.

418
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,174
We tried to find the fairest way.

419
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,300
Yes, we did.

420
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:42,889
What?

421
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:46,632
Nothing. I just...

422
00:19:46,757 --> 00:19:48,737
I used to have to do
this part alone,

423
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:50,412
and it was the worst.

424
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,401
I've something
I would like to give you.

425
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:01,538
Michael's my only friend left
in the office.

426
00:20:02,864 --> 00:20:04,073
Except Pam...

427
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,476
I think.

428
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,614
Is she still upset?

429
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:12,885
You cannot
just keep avoiding us like this!

430
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:18,326
You're welcome.

431
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,686
What's in here?

432
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:43,875
Just pretend we're not here.

433
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:48,705
You're looking for cash
for the wedding?

434
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,999
I mean,
if it's all the same for you.

435
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,124
Question for you.
Would you guys rather have $100 now

436
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,462
or $5,000 a year from now?

437
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,030
$100 now for sure.

438
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,622
'Cause you just give me $50
to cover the broker fee,

439
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:03,249
I put in 100 of my own money
as the gift...

440
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,848
The hundred.
I'll just take the hundred.

441
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:09,809
Instead of $5,000 a year from now?

442
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:13,074
How sure is this?

443
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,843
The guy has an algorithm

444
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:18,651
to determine the winner
of any given college basketball game.

445
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,060
Don't tell Jim.
