1
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:12,405
Happy Halloween, everyone!
Oh, that's great.

2
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,743
Hey. Happy Halloween.

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,047
Jan called.

4
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,708
Okay.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,914
I know why she's calling.

6
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,651
It's the end of the month,

7
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:29,559
and I was supposed to let somebody
go by the end of the month.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,188
And somehow I'm supposed
to put on a costume and smile.

9
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,735
Okay.
Jan Levinson's office.

10
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,136
Hey, Sherry,
Michael Scott returning.

11
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,833
Oh, she's in a meeting.

12
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,570
She just wanted the name
of the employee you let go.

13
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,441
Well, I'm gonna wait
until the end of the day,

14
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,004
because the book said it's best
to wait until the end of the day.

15
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,346
I just need the name of who
you're planning to let go.

16
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:55,821
I don't know yet.
I will have to call her back.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,217
I know she wanted the name.

18
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,617
Okay, Sherry?
Yeah.

19
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:06,057
If you were getting fired,
how would you wanna be told

20
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:10,000
so that you could still be
friends with the person firing you?

21
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,502
Jan wants the name
as soon as possible, Michael.

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,905
Thanks. I'll call her back.

23
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,938
I wish I could fire Sherry.

24
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,109
Hey, I'm still here.
Okay. I'm sorry.

25
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,377
Yeah.
No.

26
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,611
Okay.
Bye.

27
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,209
Hanging up now.

28
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,885
I mean, you hear
about layoffs in the news,

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,363
but when you actually have to do it
yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's...

30
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,900
I mean, these are people's
lives you're talking about.

31
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,098
You wanted me?
Yes.

32
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,336
Papier-mache?
Yes. Yes.

33
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:29,837
Um...

34
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,810
Pam, I have to let
somebody go today.

35
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,247
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

36
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,222
Why did you put it off
until Halloween?

37
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,725
Because it's very scary stuff.

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,224
I think it's gonna put a
damper on the party a little.

39
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,129
You're worried about the party?
There's a man's life at stake here.

40
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,928
So it's a man?
No.

41
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,826
Or woman. A human life.

42
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,870
If you had to guess
who it would be

43
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,103
based on their job performance

44
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,806
and who you think deserves to
be fired, who would that be?

45
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,149
I just answer the phone.

46
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,909
And sometimes you just
let it go to voicemail.

47
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,920
Your costume is fantastic.

48
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,931
I know. I sent away for
it in July from a catalog.

49
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,965
Oh, no. Don't, don't,
don't, don't.

50
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,599
Okay.

51
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,639
Oh, man.
Okay, I have to fire somebody.

52
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,117
What is that? What
are you supposed to be?

53
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,516
I'm the three-hole
punch version of Jim,

54
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,151
'cause you can have me either way,
plain white Jim or three-hole punch.

55
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,752
That's great. I like it.
Oh? Yeah.

56
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,127
Yeah, well, look.
What about me?

57
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,763
What are...

58
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,062
What are you? A monk?

59
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,697
I'm a Sith lord.

60
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,409
Oh, big deal.

61
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,670
Three round pieces of paper
taped to a shirt.

62
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,405
This cost me $129.

63
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,377
Ass.

64
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,180
Hey, you guys
excited about the party?

65
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,851
It's gonna be fun.

66
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,019
Yeah.
Yes.

67
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,724
Oh, and look at you.
Showing your colors.

68
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,966
Don't you wish you wore a dress
every day. What are you implying?

69
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,435
All good. Happy Halloween.

70
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,664
What happened to all of those
spooky decorations that we had,

71
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,299
the cobwebs and such?

72
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,209
Yeah, I don't know.
We put them all up last night.

73
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,548
Well, you know what? Go buy some
more. I'll approve the overages.

74
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,779
Sound good?
Yeah.

75
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,946
Good.

76
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,524
Oh, yeah, also,
about budget stuff...

77
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:53,849
Um...

78
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,726
I'm gonna need you to find, like, a
full employee salary plus benefits.

79
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,321
Like 50 grand.

80
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,590
I'm gonna need you to find
50 grand in the numbers.

81
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,432
But we don't keep
two sets of books.

82
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,904
Well, that's not what I'm
saying. Just, you know, find it.

83
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,407
Pretend that your jobs
depend on it.

84
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,477
Interesting take on Dorothy.
I love it.

85
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:24,114
Hey, you know what would even be
better? A soccer ball and cleats.

86
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,784
Why is that?
Bend It Like Beckham.

87
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,189
Oh, like the movie about the
Indian girl who plays soccer?

88
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,697
Yeah, that would be perfect.

89
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,768
Yeah, I mean,
I guess I could do that.

90
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,963
It'd be funny. I don't really
play soccer or anything.

91
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,734
Well, I don't really
have two heads. So...

92
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:45,869
Wait, what are you again?
Oh, right. Three-hole punch!

93
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,747
Okay, greatest strength.
Okay, okay.

94
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,484
A dog-like obedience
to authority. Nice.

95
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,789
But that doesn't sound good.
Okay, okay.

96
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,984
How about the ultimate
team player?

97
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,821
Dwight is special.

98
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:10,191
But I don't believe that his talents
are being used in this office.

99
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,635
So Pam and I
have put his resume

100
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,731
on Monster. Com,
Google, Craig's List.

101
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:20,306
We're really interested most in
jobs that take Dwight out of state.

102
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,407
Preferably Alaska or India.

103
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,207
He's a gun nut.

104
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,482
Sticks to his guns.

105
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,649
Well, I looked through
all the budgets

106
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,351
and there is one department... Yes.

107
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,155
...that has three people...
Yeah.

108
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,492
...doing the work
that could be done by two.

109
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,053
This is great.

110
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,490
Oh.

111
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,461
Yeah.

112
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,761
Oh.

113
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,366
Who do you think it
should be? Jim, definitely.

114
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,875
No, Jim brings in money.

115
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,570
Phyllis?
No.

116
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:56,274
Stanley, Pam,
Oscar, Meredith,

117
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,974
Kevin, Angela.

118
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,746
It's not a popularity contest.

119
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,051
Although it does make sense
to fire the least popular

120
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,058
because that has
the least effect on morale.

121
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,052
One of the warehouse guys.

122
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,822
What?

123
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,699
There is someone left off that
list? Who? Who is he saying?

124
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,935
You're right. I didn't
even think of him.

125
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,539
No, Michael.

126
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,667
Yeah, that's actually
a really good idea. No.

127
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,645
No. Not me.
Yeah, I could.

128
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,705
Not Dwight. I'm not
saying that's what he said.

129
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,546
I know that's what he said.

130
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,710
What?

131
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,451
Tell him not Dwight.

132
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,717
That is not a very nice thing
to say about him.

133
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,883
Tell him to stop.

134
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,654
Are you kidding?
Quiet, you!

135
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,592
I agree.
He'd land on his feet.

136
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,857
Make him be quiet.

137
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,631
Those aren't chips and dip.
No, I made brownies.

138
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,299
What?

139
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:59,105
I'm just trying to figure out
why you're sabotaging things.

140
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,480
I made brownies. And I
made cookies. Same category.

141
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,785
I'm guessing Angela's
the one in the neighborhood

142
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,917
who gives the trick-or-treaters
some toothbrushes,

143
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,522
pennies,

144
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,059
walnuts...

145
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,962
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

146
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,860
Yeah.

147
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:29,368
Just one second. I will transfer
you to our manager, Michael Scott.

148
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,136
Wow.

149
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,577
Michael Scott here.

150
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,553
Yes, I am regional manager
of this orifice.

151
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,347
Hmm-hmm.

152
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,326
Dwight Schrute is amazing.

153
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Yeah.

154
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:53,392
No, he is actually the single
greatest employee of his generation.

155
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,356
Hmm-hmm.

156
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,092
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what.

157
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:01,162
You hire Dwight K. Schrute
and he does not meet,

158
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,939
nay, exceed every one
of your wildest expectations,

159
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:10,676
well, then, you can hold me,
Michael Gary Scott

160
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,716
personally and
financially responsible.

161
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,983
Okay. Okay. Okay.

162
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,816
Okay.

163
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,233
Stanley, could you come
with me, please? No.

164
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,804
As Assistant Regional Manager... To the?

165
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,535
Look, I've got some bad news.

166
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,373
You're fired. You need to
pack up your things and go.

167
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,643
I'm serious, Stanley.
It's over. I'm sorry.

168
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,241
"You're fired. "

169
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,083
Get your fingers off my phone.

170
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,261
So, how did it go with
Stanley? How did he take it?

171
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,390
He wouldn't listen to me.
Oh, come on.

172
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,798
If you wanna fire him, you're
gonna have to tell him yourself.

173
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,893
I don't wanna fire Stanley.
I never said that.

174
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,735
I'm certainly not going
to do it myself.

175
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,137
Get those big baleful
eyes staring at me.

176
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,236
Yikes. Just... Okay, just...

177
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,508
Cumberland Mills?

178
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,215
And how did you get my resume?

179
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,320
Oh, no, no. I'm very
flattered. Don't get me wrong.

180
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,655
I'm just not sure that
it's my official resume

181
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,025
or if it's something
that maybe

182
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,121
a satisfied customer
posted online.

183
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,525
What does it say
under martial arts training?

184
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,039
Oh, okay, I'm gonna
have to supplement that.

185
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,337
Could I have your fax number?

186
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,309
Would I ever leave this company?
Look, I'm all about loyalty.

187
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:51,572
In fact, I feel like part of what I'm
getting paid for here is my loyalty.

188
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:56,111
But if there were somewhere else
that valued that loyalty more highly,

189
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,025
I'm going wherever
they value loyalty the most.

190
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,323
Oh, hey.

191
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,765
Oh, your dress is stuck
in the back. Gotta just...

192
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,823
Oh.

193
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,301
So you got the fax.

194
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,672
So why didn't you add it
to the resume?

195
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,678
What do you mean? Of course,
martial arts training is relevant.

196
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,872
Oh, excuse me,

197
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,007
I know about a billion Asians
that would beg to differ.

198
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,345
Yeah, I get a little frustrated
when I'm dealing with incompetence!

199
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,151
Well, you know what?
You can go to hell, too,

200
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,487
and I will see you there
burning.

201
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,723
Fine. Oh, wait, so you'll let me
know when you've made a decision...

202
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,934
Jim is really talented.

203
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,906
And he should be the one who's
getting a better job offer.

204
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,463
Like, for real.

205
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:54,172
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you should go for that job.

206
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,476
Um...

207
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,383
It's in Maryland.
Yeah.

208
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,753
But, I mean,
look at the salary,

209
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:09,193
and it's definitely
a step up and a challenge.

210
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,689
Yeah.

211
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,063
Yeah. You know what, maybe...

212
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,139
Maybe I will.

213
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,537
Jim.

214
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,947
This is called
leveraging an offer.

215
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,783
Michael, can I talk to
you for a moment? Oh, God.

216
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:39,086
I just thought you should know
that I was just offered a job

217
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,490
with better pay,
better benefits,

218
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,552
and a better title
at Cumberland Mills.

219
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,689
Fantastic.
And I turned it down.

220
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,166
What? That would have
solved all my problems.

221
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:53,331
Out of loyalty to this
company. Oh, you idiot. Go.

222
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,431
So I was hoping to be made Assistant
Regional Manager officially.

223
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,103
If you left, I wouldn't
have to fire anybody.

224
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,339
But then you wouldn't
have me here. Big deal.

225
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,382
Oh, it would have worked out
so well. Can you get it back?

226
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,543
It's in Maryland. You could
call. Can you call them?

227
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,349
I can't... I suppose I... No.

228
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,347
They never really made me
an offer anyway.

229
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,460
Why are you torturing me?
God.

230
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:22,561
Honestly, I don't think Michael has the
slightest clue of who he's gonna fire.

231
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,536
I think he keeps hoping that
someone's gonna volunteer,

232
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,539
or be run over by a bus
before the deadline.

233
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,272
But in the end, really,
what's gonna happen is

234
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,938
it's gonna be the first person to
give him a dirty look in the hall.

235
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,949
And therein lies the true
essence of his charisma.

236
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:43,188
Can I speak to you a minute?
Yes.

237
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,873
Michael, I really didn't
mean to... Help me.

238
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,912
I'm sorry? I want you
to role-play firing me.

239
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,479
I want you to fire me,
and I will take it.

240
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,624
Oh, you want me to be you.
Yes.

241
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,684
Okay. I want you to be
me and I will be Creed.

242
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,752
Oh, are you firing Creed?
No, no, no.

243
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,322
That's just first thing...
Came... Can't... That head...

244
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,767
We should switch seats in order
to... Yes, that's a good idea.

245
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,168
All right?

246
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,437
Excuse me.

247
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,710
I'm really sorry,
but I have to let you go.

248
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:46,273
And it's purely budgetary.
It's not personal...

249
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,588
I'm gonna kill myself!
Wow.

250
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,489
I'm going to kill myself
and it's your fault!

251
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,151
That's an overreaction.

252
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,718
Corporate is really
breathing down my neck

253
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,356
and they're saying this has to
be done by the end of the month...

254
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,730
Is this you? Are you being
you? Or is this Creed?

255
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,530
Are you...
I am...

256
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,536
This is Creed.
Okay.

257
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,439
I'm improvising.
So just try to keep up.

258
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,033
And I'm very angry.
Hold that thought.

259
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,170
And I want... I'm gonna
kill you. Michael Scott here.

260
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,373
I'm gonna kill you for firing me. Toby.

261
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,540
I really have to take this,
Creed,

262
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,584
so it was really a pleasure
working with you, okay?

263
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,348
Get off. Get off.
No, no. Just get up.

264
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,055
Just, just... Yeah.

265
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,390
What happened?
It wasn't me.

266
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:38,459
Oh, that was, like, crazy,
because I was... Yeah, I know.

267
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,045
Hey, Creed?

268
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,782
Could I talk to you
for a second?

269
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,858
You are great
and very ambitious,

270
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,522
and I feel like you want more than
this little office has to offer.

271
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,828
And I understand that you'd
want to just spread your wings

272
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,002
and fly the coop.
What are you telling me?

273
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,768
We're gonna have to...
You want something better.

274
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,241
No, I don't.
I wanna stay right here.

275
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,643
No, you wanna leave.
No, I wanna stay here.

276
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,274
Now, why are you
making this so hard?

277
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,147
I think there's a
misunderstanding about this.

278
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,446
I think you're right.

279
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,953
Can I go?
No, of course you can't go!

280
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,719
We haven't even started
this horrible process of...

281
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,251
Okay, Creed.

282
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:40,120
I need to let
somebody go today.

283
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,161
They told me I need to
let somebody go.

284
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,966
And as much as I think you're
a great guy, and I like you,

285
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,371
you're... Goodbye.

286
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,200
Let's fight it.

287
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,537
Let's call Jan and fight this
thing together like the old days.

288
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,241
What old days?
What are you talking about?

289
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,943
Did you start
the paperwork yet?

290
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,315
It's right here
on the desk, yeah.

291
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,854
You don't have to do this,
Michael. I can't, though.

292
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,185
Undo it!
I can't change anything.

293
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,248
This is the way it... No.
You have the power to undo it.

294
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,658
I don't. Okay, just let's
not... You can undo it.

295
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,093
Michael, undo it!

296
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,256
Yeah, I went hunting once.
Shot the deer in the leg.

297
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,395
Had to kill it with a shovel,
took about an hour.

298
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,697
Why do you ask?

299
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,706
I have to fire someone
today. Okay?

300
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:26,336
Fine. Fire someone else.
Fire Devon. He's terrible.

301
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,040
I am so much better
at my job than Devon.

302
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,083
Okay, well, I already
picked you and you know that,

303
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,052
so, unless I just
go through with this,

304
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,782
you're always gonna look at me
as the guy who almost fired you.

305
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:42,054
No, no, no, no, no, no. I will
forget so fast. You will be my savior.

306
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,324
You're the guy
who gave me my life back.

307
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,489
Thank you. I knew
you'd see it my way, Michael.

308
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,625
God bless you.

309
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,259
You're a fine man.
Don't...

310
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,997
Listen, you will not
regret this, either.

311
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,597
Devon is terrible.
No one's gonna miss him.

312
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,576
Good, good, good, good.

313
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,423
Devon, could I
talk to you for a second?

314
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,322
Creed's an idiot. You
know that. Well, he...

315
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,368
No, no, no, no, no, no. You
had it right the first time!

316
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,303
Well, maybe I did. Exactly,
you gotta go with your gut, man.

317
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,306
No, I can't...

318
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,368
No, I can't go back.
I would look like an idiot.

319
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,107
That's why I'm being fired?
No.

320
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,671
So you might not look
like an idiot?

321
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,239
No, it was all the stuff
that I said.

322
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,786
It was the business downturn
and cutbacks, and...

323
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,186
You...
God, this is unbelievable!

324
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,248
I just hope that you
and I can remain friends.

325
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,286
Devon, wait. Please.
What?

326
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,831
Look, look.

327
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,163
In addition to severance
and everything,

328
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,070
I want to give you

329
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,734
this gift certificate
to Chili's from me.

330
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,413
Okay? No hard feelings.

331
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,680
Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly,
Toby, Oscar, Meredith,

332
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,187
Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp.

333
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,585
If any of you wanna meet me for a
drink, I'm gonna be at Poor Richard's.

334
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,153
And the rest of you
can go to hell.

335
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,503
What about
the Halloween party?

336
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,511
Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop.

337
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,616
I'm sorry for pushing you
toward Cumberland.

338
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,680
Seriously, if you left here,
I would blow my brains out.

339
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,020
Come on.

340
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,122
That's just
a figure of speech, you know.

341
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,392
Blow your brains out? Come on.

342
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,433
All it really means is
that we're friends.

343
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:06,198
And who else is she gonna
talk to if I'm gone? Right?

344
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,774
I mean, if she left,
I wouldn't blow my brains out.

345
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:13,436
Of course, I would take that job in
Maryland because it's double the pay

346
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:17,073
and soft-shell crab just
happens to be my favorite food.

347
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,149
I love Halloween.

348
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,854
You know, it's just... But it's
just fun. Every year, it's just fun.

349
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:33,125
Last Halloween, I came
as Janet Jackson's boob.

350
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,567
It was topical. People
got a big kick out of it.

351
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,628
The year before that
I came as Monica Lewinsky,

352
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,333
and I wore a stained dress.

353
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,742
The year before that, I
also came as Monica Lewinsky,

354
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,748
and before that I was O. J.
It was pretty funny.

355
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,943
Oh, I wish you were
here last year.

356
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,758
Trick-or-treat!

357
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,729
Hey. How you doing?

358
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,856
Wow, you guys look great!

359
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,061
I'm a bumble bee.
You look great.

360
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,465
And you're a princess?
A fairy princess.

361
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,699
A fairy princess. You're
very... I'm a lion!

362
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,833
You're a lion. Wow.
I wanna hear your...

363
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,003
Oh! Okay, that's all yours.
That's all yours. Okay!

364
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,137
Grab it. Grab it.

365
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,079
You know what? You guys
are getting all of these.
