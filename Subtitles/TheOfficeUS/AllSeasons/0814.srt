1
00:00:02,554 --> 00:00:04,521
Oh, look who's back
reporting for duty.

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:05,789
Hey, guys.

3
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:07,557
Hey.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,326
Hey, Pam, ah!

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,094
Look what I can do now that
she's no longer pregnant.

6
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:12,829
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

7
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:14,331
Are you glad to be back?

8
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:17,200
Yeah-- Yeah, I mean I could
have used another week or three.

9
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:19,635
You still had eight weeks
more than we did.

10
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,305
Well, it's not exactly
a vacation.

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,438
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey.

12
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:25,841
Remember?
Little old me, hi.

13
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:27,009
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:28,443
You just had our baby.

15
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:31,780
Our collective,
Dunder Mifflin family baby.

16
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:32,948
Four days ago.

17
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:34,483
I wanted to come back to work.

18
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,685
Not everybody needs
some long, luxurious,

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,087
- Parisian maternity leave.
- What?

20
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,356
Damn, girl, your body.

21
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,157
Angela, you look amazing.

22
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:46,827
Really? I feel like
this big rhinoceros.

23
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:49,630
Anyway, I wanted to thank
you guys for covering for me,

24
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,965
so I made some treats.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,767
I've got brownies
and magic cookie bars.

26
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,769
Nice.

27
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:57,470
Oh, Angela, those brownies
have walnuts in them

28
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:59,039
and I think Kevin's
allergic to walnuts.

29
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:00,640
You're allergic to walnuts,
right, Kevin?

30
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:03,010
Extremely, but I'm going
to fight through it.

31
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:04,544
Aw, it's okay, Angela.

32
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:05,913
I have mommy-brain too.

33
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:07,747
I don't know what that is, Pam.

34
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:09,749
I made a batch with no nuts,
special for you, Kevin.

35
00:01:09,784 --> 00:01:11,050
- It's right here.
- Ooh.

36
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:12,385
When did you find time
to do all this?

37
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:13,953
Babies sleep a lot, Pam.

38
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:15,955
If you feed them enough.

39
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:21,961
Brownie, Pam?

40
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:24,931
Thank you.

41
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:27,498
Oh, my gosh, it's really good.

42
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:33,371
I wouldn't know,
I'm watching my weight.

43
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:35,673
So, you guys, you know what's
an even more useful treat

44
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:38,143
- is cash, so--
- Nope, it's over.

45
00:01:38,177 --> 00:01:40,045
- We wanted to say thank you--
- Nope. Okay.

46
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,817
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,021
Dwight, I have
exciting news for you.

48
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:52,423
What?

49
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:54,591
I think you're
going to like it.

50
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,060
You can't tantalize me.

51
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:57,894
Oh, maybe I can.

52
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:00,696
I got an e-mail
from corporate

53
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:06,035
- okay.
- That told me that you got a promotion.

54
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,536
Right? I mean,
that's not the kind of thing

55
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:09,238
you want to read
quietly at your desk.

56
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:11,607
If you make me head of sales
one more time, I swear.

57
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,908
No, this is legit.

58
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:15,177
You will be assembling
a team to go to Tallahassee

59
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:20,048
for three weeks to develop and
launch a chain of Sabre stores.

60
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,618
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

61
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:29,624
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

62
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:31,758
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,094
The Schrutes have a word
for when everything

64
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:36,097
in a man's life
comes together perfectly.

65
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:38,165
<i>Perfectenschlag.</i>

66
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,700
Right now, I am in it.

67
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:41,969
I finally get a chance
to prove myself to corporate.

68
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:44,438
I am assembling
a competent team.

69
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:45,973
I am likely a father.

70
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:50,276
I am so deep inside
of <i>perfectenschlag</i> right now.

71
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:53,380
And, just to be clear,
there is a second definition,

72
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:56,216
"perfect pork anus,"
which I don't mean.

73
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,551
And here's the fax for you.

74
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:00,753
And here's some facts for you.

75
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:03,355
Did you know frogs
can hear with their lungs?

76
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,259
And that flamingos can have
orgasms that last 30 minutes.

77
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:08,994
Love to learn.

78
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:11,130
Yeah, it's weird
that I said that last one.

79
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:12,831
So...

80
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:14,400
Uh, yeah, look at that.

81
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,335
- We're pin twins.
- Pin twins.

82
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:18,637
This is a gift from Jessica,
kind of a gag gift, really.

83
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,338
Real gifts come later.

84
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:22,473
Yeah, that's cute.

85
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:26,844
When I saw it in CVS,
it made me gag too.

86
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:33,984
For awhile there, I thought
something would change,

87
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,286
but, nope,
Andy's still with Jessica.

88
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,422
They even carpool
together most days.

89
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:42,959
I don't know, I wouldn't mind
carpooling every day with Andy.

90
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:47,197
But I wouldn't want to spend
that much time with Jessica.

91
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:53,202
What do we have here?

92
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,204
Val knit me a beanie.

93
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,173
But I can't tell if it's a
"we're just friends" beanie

94
00:03:57,207 --> 00:04:00,209
or a "I'm hot, you're hot,
let's get it popping" beanie.

95
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:02,344
So I'm going to up the ante,

96
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,847
give her
a clearly romantic gift.

97
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:08,716
And we'll get
to the meaning of the beanie.

98
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,186
Pam, pack up your
postnatal swimwear,

99
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,154
make it a one-piece,
or this offer is rescinded,

100
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,890
and join me for a fantastic
barbecue, one week from today,

101
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:17,692
in Tallahassee, Florida,
where I'm going to be living

102
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:19,026
for the next three weeks.

103
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,395
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:22,797
I'll fly anywhere
for some good barbecue.

105
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:23,897
Ooh, me three.

106
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,466
No plus-ones.

107
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,767
This is for competent
workers only.

108
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:30,571
And don't worry about the cost,
Sabre is footing the bill.

109
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:31,738
Does this have anything
to do with

110
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,772
what you were talking
to Andy about?

111
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:38,044
God, you're such a spy.

112
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,845
Notice anything
different about me?

113
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,514
You're wearing the beanie.

114
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,815
You like it?

115
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,218
Super comfortable,
like sweatpants for my head.

116
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,586
I love it too, Val.

117
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,855
It's really itchy,
but to be fair,

118
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,524
my head is constantly itching.

119
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:55,160
So I can't really
peg it on the hat.

120
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,597
Wow, it's like
the nation of islam down here.

121
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,600
I like to knit.
Don't hate.

122
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,368
And who's that for?

123
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:08,540
Oh, this is a gift
for my man, Nate, here.

124
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,674
- What?
- Yeah.

125
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,009
Darryl, you shouldn't have.

126
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:14,178
- Can I open it?
- No, no, no, maybe just--

127
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:17,114
Ah, I can't wait,
I'm sorry, I'm too excited.

128
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:23,320
Darryl.

129
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:24,888
Wow, those are really nice.

130
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:27,490
- They're so elegant.
- Cashmere.

131
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:28,525
How'd you know?

132
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:31,561
Just a hunch.

133
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:33,129
Your gift is on the way.

134
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:35,598
Can't wait.

135
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,468
I'm glad you're in my life,
happy Valentine's day.

136
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:39,636
Oh, Darryl.

137
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,705
I am glad to be
in your life too.

138
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:48,577
Your card is more beautiful
than the gloves.

139
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:52,714
My first task as Special
Project Manager, Dwight Schrute?

140
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,849
Assembling a crack team.

141
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,018
I need people who are loyal.

142
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:58,887
People who will help me
get an inroad

143
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:01,289
with the gay-hispanic
community.

144
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:03,957
People who won't be missed.

145
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:07,595
- We don't need idiots.
- This hurts.

146
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:09,463
Good for nothings.

147
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:11,599
Meth-heads.

148
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:15,235
Or--
What's your name?

149
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:16,403
Kathy.

150
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:17,904
Kathy.

151
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:24,611
I just got a text
from Robert California

152
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:26,813
that says,
"bring your clubs to Florida."

153
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,014
Why?

154
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:29,549
Does he think
you're going to Florida?

155
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:32,384
I hope not,
because I am not going.

156
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,586
Two question marks.

157
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,020
No, just do one.

158
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,323
Two question marks
is kind of aggressive.

159
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:39,491
You know, it's like,
"wh-- what?"

160
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:42,261
Just do one.

161
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:43,729
You want to take
Darryl, Phyllis,

162
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:46,164
- Toby, Angela, and Oscar?
- Yes.

163
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,633
Can I interest you
in someone less essential?

164
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,336
Like a--
A Creed or a Meredith perhaps?

165
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,204
- Oh, my God.
- They're not expendable,

166
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,005
exactly, I just can't--
I can't think of the word

167
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,107
I'm trying to find.

168
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:57,342
Are you kidding me?

169
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,244
I'm supposed to get on an
airplane with those nincompoops?

170
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,478
We'd never
make it off the runway.

171
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:02,280
All right, look, I got to keep

172
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:04,781
this office functioning
somehow, so--

173
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:06,550
I have put together a list.

174
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:07,917
Here's your team.

175
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:09,886
Darryl and Phyllis,
you can have.

176
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,322
But you're also taking
Kathy, Kelly, and Kevin.

177
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:13,523
Oh, God.

178
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,558
You have your team.

179
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:17,494
Kevin? Kelly? Kathy?

180
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:20,095
Andy just gave me
a chain with three weak links.

181
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,164
Have you ever tried to use
a chain with three weak links?

182
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:25,134
I have, and now I no longer
own an arctic wolf.

183
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:29,813
Well, let's hear it.

184
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:30,914
"Robert, hey!"
Exclamation point.

185
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:31,815
I like it so far.

186
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,684
"Got your text, awesome idea.

187
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,585
Let's hit the links
the next time you're in PA."

188
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,986
Dash, JH.

189
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,121
It's perfect.

190
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:41,990
You emphasized the golf,
completely omit the Florida.

191
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,225
Yeah, it's a golf text.

192
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,828
Total golf text, send it.

193
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:48,864
Done--
Wait, I just feel weird.

194
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:50,232
I should just call him.

195
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,735
You want to call someone
that texted you?

196
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,837
Do you want to drive them away?
I mean--?

197
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:59,674
This is Darryl.

198
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,909
Oh, sorry, I asked
for the main shipping number.

199
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:03,378
I just need the address
for the warehouse.

200
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,447
I want to send my girlfriend
some flowers.

201
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,449
Your girlfriend?

202
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:08,616
Is your girlfriend Val?

203
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:11,184
Yeah, do you know her?

204
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,823
We're friends, we're friends.

205
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:19,059
Cool. Uh, so can I get
that address or--?

206
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:22,195
Yeah, yeah, sorry,
I'm just looking for a pen.

207
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,364
Why do you need a pen?

208
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:25,432
Back off.
I got my reasons.

209
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,132
May I have
your attention, please?

210
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,301
Could Kathy, Phyllis, Darryl,
Kevin, and Kelly please

211
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:31,003
join me in the conference room
immediately.

212
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,572
- Why?
- Oh, no big deal.

213
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:34,674
It's just that you five
have been deemed most deserving

214
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,042
of a three-week,
all expenses paid business trip

215
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:38,310
to Tallahassee, Florida.

216
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:39,612
Hell, yeah.

217
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,013
What?

218
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:42,314
Oh, I'm sorry, Stanley.

219
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:43,515
I can't share any more
details with you.

220
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,984
You see, Andy rejected you.

221
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:47,853
Wait, Kathy gets to go?

222
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:49,220
Why does she even
still work here?

223
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:50,889
Pam is back.

224
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:52,223
It just feels like
a slap in the face.

225
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:53,859
I can understand your pain
and your rage,

226
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:55,660
but you know what?
Andy is an honorable man,

227
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:57,061
let us not question
his choices.

228
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:59,162
I'm sure he had his reasons.

229
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:00,464
We're not questioning
his reasons.

230
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,732
I just want to know
what they are.

231
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,100
I know, you and me both,
brother.

232
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,102
It seemed kind of random to me,
but he was pretty clear

233
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:06,637
on who he thought
truly deserved

234
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,238
this boondoggle of a lifetime.

235
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:09,774
Well, he nailed it.

236
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:12,976
Because I do deserve
a vacation.

237
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,911
Sometimes Batman's
got to take off his cape.

238
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:16,212
Good point,

239
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:17,980
but we're going to be working
pretty hard until 5:00 P.M.

240
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,983
After that, it's gonna be
beach volleyball,

241
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,218
trips to Cape Canaveral,

242
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:24,721
and sea-kayaking
with Gloria Estefan.

243
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,489
What were the criteria
for going?

244
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,826
It might be innate goodness
versus innate badness.

245
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,462
But there's an easy way
to find out.

246
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:37,399
Oh, Andy,
got a few questions for you.

247
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,768
<i>Moshi moshi.</i>

248
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:42,203
Uh, the Florida picks got out,

249
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:43,772
and people were just
kind of curious

250
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:45,373
as to why they weren't picked,

251
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,074
and maybe you could
just clarify.

252
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:52,547
Uh, well, the deliberations
were confidential,

253
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:55,015
so I feel like
we should respect that.

254
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,250
Respect it?

255
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:57,585
You're trying to tell me
Kevin Malone

256
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,253
deserves more
than Stanley Hudson?

257
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:00,688
Hey.

258
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,456
Okay, it's obvious
that Andy picked the people

259
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,624
that are least important
to the office.

260
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:05,859
Important?

261
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:07,393
Oh, because you and your
enormous monster-baby

262
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:08,728
are so important to the branch.

263
00:10:08,763 --> 00:10:10,597
My baby is not a monster.

264
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:12,766
Hey, be proud of your
enormous monster-baby.

265
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,835
I was once
an enormous monster-baby.

266
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:19,404
Guys, guys, guys,
come on, seriously?

267
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:23,275
We cannot let this trip
cause this kind of rift, guys.

268
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:24,643
Stop calling us "guys."

269
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:28,113
I use the word "guys"
a lot when I'm nervous.

270
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:29,114
Guys.

271
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:31,951
- Guys, guys, guys.
- Andy, please.

272
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:33,586
Stop it, Andy.

273
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,219
- Dudes--
- Andy.

274
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:37,254
The dudes
who are going to Florida

275
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:39,791
were picked by Dwight and me.

276
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:42,093
Okay, hey, I specifically
remember that there were

277
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:45,129
a lot of other people
I thought should be considered.

278
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:46,998
If anybody's going
to Florida, it should be me.

279
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:48,800
Every shirt that I have
that isn't a work shirt

280
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,301
is a Tommy Bahama.

281
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:53,036
I'm the only person in this
office who watches <i>Burn Notice.</i>

282
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,305
Okay, I did not realize
that so many of you

283
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:56,573
wanted to go so badly.

284
00:10:56,608 --> 00:10:58,842
So if you feel like
you have a very good reason

285
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:00,310
to go to Florida,
I'm happy to hear you out.

286
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:01,812
Great idea.

287
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:03,547
So why doesn't everyone just
take the next five to six hours,

288
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,115
come up with a statement
on why you feel you deserve

289
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:06,916
to go to Florida, and Andy
and I will listen to it.

290
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,484
No, that is a ridiculous
waste of time.

291
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,752
For you, maybe.

292
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:11,453
- Five to six hours?
- Three to four hours.

293
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:13,322
- No, no, no, no.
- Just two to three hours--

294
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:15,791
come up with a statement
over the next hour.

295
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,359
30 minutes.

296
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:19,294
I'm out.

297
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:20,429
Okay, read it back to me.

298
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:21,797
"Robert, great offer."

299
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:23,197
Wish I could hit the links
with you in Florida,

300
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,466
but a father of a newborn
really should be helping out

301
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,668
"his wife
any chance he gets."

302
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:29,137
Good, doesn't sound pushy.

303
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:30,338
You're just stating a fact.

304
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:32,306
Absolutely.
Works for me.

305
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:35,677
- Okay, sending.
- Well done.

306
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:37,478
And we managed to kill
the entire morning.

307
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:38,446
We really did.

308
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:47,220
He responded "LOL."

309
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:57,697
I have a new swimsuit
I need to break in.

310
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,498
I already picked my team.

311
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:02,201
Darryl, Oscar, Angela,
Phyllis, and Toby.

312
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,170
And that is the team
that I am taking.

313
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:05,504
What's that?
It's not up to me?

314
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:07,406
I only have influence?

315
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:10,309
Well, that's all
Baltzer Glattfielder had,

316
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:13,712
and now no one
eats owls for Thanksgiving.

317
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:15,547
You have two young,
dynamic people in this office

318
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:17,616
who know trends,
who know youth.

319
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,752
That's myself and Kelly Kapoor.
You need one of us there.

320
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:22,487
Or both.

321
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:24,489
Not both.
Just one. Me.

322
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:26,624
Or if not me, Kelly.
Ideally, me.

323
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,292
Again, youth knowledge.

324
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:29,994
That's what you get
when you put Ryan Howard

325
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:31,395
on your Special Project Team.

326
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:36,133
Or Kelly Kapoor.
Again, not both. Thanks.

327
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,668
Very impressive.

328
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,403
He put a lot of work into that.

329
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:42,506
Powerpoints are the peacocks
of the business world.

330
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,674
All show, no meat.

331
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,542
Because I feel like
that I'm at a place

332
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:48,377
with my gambling rehab

333
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:51,915
that I can finally start
going to dog racing again.

334
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:56,820
You know, just sitting,
watching, enjoying the sport.

335
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:59,054
Maybe putting down a few
dollars, if there's, like,

336
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,389
a crazy mismatch or something.

337
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:03,425
Okay, thank you, Kevin.
We'll let you know.

338
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,260
- Thank you.
- When do we leave?

339
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:06,829
Thank you.

340
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:10,065
It has been a long,
lonely winter.

341
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,936
Wow, seasonal affective
disorder, aka, "SAD."

342
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,771
That sounds like
a very real thing, Toby.

343
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:19,641
It is real.
Thank you for saying that.

344
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,676
Yeah, wow, it's almost like

345
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,547
we're not all experiencing
the same winter.

346
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:27,949
"Florida Stanley" smiles.

347
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:30,151
"Florida Stanley"
is happy to go to work.

348
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:35,522
"Florida Stanley" is who
you want on your Florida team.

349
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,724
It's still, well--

350
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,760
Hey, guys, any spots left?

351
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:41,594
Erin, you want
to go to Tallahassee?

352
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,864
I do.
I really do.

353
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:46,366
I think it would be
a nice way to clear my head.

354
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,801
You know, I don't think
it's a good idea for you

355
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:51,070
to clear your head anymore
than it has been already.

356
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:53,706
I think you need a workplace
where the burdens

357
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,809
of everyday life keep you
tethered to reality.

358
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:58,210
Either or.

359
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:01,080
But if you can find someone
to fill in, I would love to go.

360
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:04,415
Well, it wouldn't be hard
to find someone to fill in.

361
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:08,153
Really?
Oh, great, good.

362
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:10,822
Now, is it too dark to say
that Cece's having an operation?

363
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:13,958
I think you
need to go to Florida.

364
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,660
I think you're right.

365
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:16,995
It's only for three weeks.

366
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,763
You know, with my mom and sister
at the house it'll be--

367
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:22,032
- A total nightmare.
- I was going to say,

368
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:23,734
"good, because I'll have
all the help I need."

369
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:25,169
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

370
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:26,369
They're incredibly helpful.
You're lucky to have them.

371
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:27,604
I mean, with them there,

372
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:29,173
you probably
won't even know I'm gone.

373
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:31,975
Exactly.

374
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,610
Well--

375
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:36,212
No, no, absolutely not.

376
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:38,647
You are not going.
Over my dead body, no.

377
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:41,217
Tunes, I'm really sorry.

378
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:42,952
You're too essential
to the operation here.

379
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:44,286
I can't let you go.

380
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:46,388
I wouldn't say that.
That's a bit much.

381
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:47,523
You know, Dwight,
if you didn't want me to go,

382
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:48,891
the smart move would be
to tell Andy

383
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,559
that I actually <i>am</i>
essential to the operation.

384
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,493
That way I couldn't go.

385
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:53,729
Jim is essential to--

386
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:56,698
Hold on, just want
to get it on camera.

387
00:14:56,733 --> 00:15:00,802
Andy,
Jim is just too ess--

388
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:02,070
Essential.

389
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:03,805
This is stupid.
Cut.

390
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,207
All right, I'm going
to pack my trunks.

391
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:06,608
He doesn't even want to go.

392
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:08,976
Well, I got a text from RC
inviting me to come down,

393
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,613
so I think that's going
to make us roommates.

394
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:13,547
Oh, my God.

395
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,082
Hey, quick question.

396
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:16,516
Do you shower at night
or do you shower in the morning?

397
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:17,985
Because I want to shower
when you're showering

398
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,588
to save some water.

399
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,056
Okay, listen up, everyone.

400
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,490
Here's who's going to Florida.

401
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,892
- Kathy.
- What?

402
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,260
- Stanley.
- No.

403
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,294
- Ryan.
- No.

404
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,662
- Erin.
- Fuck.

405
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,264
And Jim.

406
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,732
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

407
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:36,803
Okay, okay.

408
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:38,837
Florida group,
welcome to the team.

409
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,043
Aah!

410
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:51,695
Let's go.
Step it up, you runts.

411
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,263
Infants, let's move.

412
00:15:53,298 --> 00:15:54,898
Why is it so hot in here?

413
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,067
Hot?
What are you talking about?

414
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:59,036
This is a nice,
temperate, Florida morning.

415
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,238
85 degrees, 73% humidity.

416
00:16:01,272 --> 00:16:03,740
This is the exact environment
that you will be facing

417
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:05,909
for the next three weeks
of your life.

418
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:09,212
Welcome to Special Projects
Orientation.

419
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:10,947
The next three weeks
of your life

420
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:14,884
are going to be the most
miserable you've ever faced.

421
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:17,786
They're going to be hard,
they're going to be dirty.

422
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:20,289
You're going to wish
you were dead.

423
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,724
But.

424
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:23,591
But?
There's no buts.

425
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,293
That's it,
you'll wish you were dead.

426
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:27,795
You seem a little disturbed,
do you want to stay here?

427
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,197
No, no, I want to go.

428
00:16:29,232 --> 00:16:31,766
Because if any of you
would prefer to stay here,

429
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,936
all you need to do
is ring this bell.

430
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:36,604
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?

431
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:38,706
- Shut up, maggot!
- It is.

432
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:40,274
You don't want to go,
ring the bell.

433
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:42,343
Ring it, ring it.

434
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:46,813
How many of you have seen
the documentary <i>Deliverance?</i>

435
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,883
How did a mosquito get in here?

436
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,318
I released 300 mosquitoes
into the conference room.

437
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:52,819
Just temporarily.

438
00:16:52,854 --> 00:16:58,591
When I'm done, the frogs will
take care of the mosquitoes.

439
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,262
Yes, then he brushes your soft,
supple cheeks

440
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:05,131
with his worn,
leathery hands and says,

441
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:08,935
"I'm going to make you
the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt."

442
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,536
Unless you ring the bell,
ring it.

443
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,669
- No.
- Ring the bell.

444
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:12,871
You want to spend
the rest of your life

445
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,472
changing your husband's
colostomy bags?

446
00:17:14,507 --> 00:17:15,774
Huh, do you?

447
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:18,176
Ring it. Ah.

448
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:19,177
What was that?

449
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:22,147
Mosquito.

450
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:30,587
Orientation's over.

451
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:32,390
Oh, Darryl, hey.

452
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:33,557
Hey, what's up?
You called?

453
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,626
Yeah, you know,
I felt really terrible

454
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,228
that you got me
these lovely gloves

455
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:38,362
and I didn't get you anything.

456
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:39,530
It's cool, really.

457
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:41,299
No, it's anything but cool.

458
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,900
Now, I haven't
really had time to go out

459
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:48,138
and buy you anything,
but here goes.

460
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:51,808
- "This coupon entitles you to
one free tickle-monster attack."

461
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:53,310
Yeah, they're Nate coupons,

462
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,511
or "Na-pons,"
and they're all different.

463
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:58,214
Cash that one in and I will
bring you a stick of gum.

464
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:01,817
Any time, any place.
I'll find you.

465
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:05,988
Thanks.

466
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:06,855
Nice flowers.

467
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:09,658
Thanks, they're from my mom.

468
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:13,929
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

469
00:18:13,964 --> 00:18:16,130
Oh, so I guess
that was your mom

470
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:18,632
who called me earlier
looking for the address?

471
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,401
Real deep-voiced woman.

472
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:22,036
Yeah, that's her.

473
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:24,738
She said her name
was Brandon, I think.

474
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:28,042
Your mom's name is Brandon?

475
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:31,911
Yeah, Darryl,
my mom's name is Brandon.

476
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,618
I guess I figured out
where I stand.

477
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:42,655
This is a love beanie.

478
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,627
Okay, Florida Team,
let's reconvene.

479
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:02,674
I'm going to Florida
and I'm not coming back.

480
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,112
So Sabre has setup
a conference room for our use

481
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,913
while we're at corporate.

482
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,581
So what is this
Special Project?

483
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,750
Basically, Sabre has
tasked us with helping them

484
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,252
branch into
the retail marketplace.

485
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,221
They want to setup their own
version of an Apple Store.

486
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,555
That sounds awesome.

487
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,589
It did, it did.

488
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:20,991
You know what might
be great is if instead

489
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,593
of a genius bar,
we have a lounge area

490
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:25,729
where people can ask questions
about the product

491
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:27,898
with other customers
who liked it.

492
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:29,666
Yeah, and they should
have a place where people

493
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,102
can check their computers
or printers before they see you

494
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,804
so you don't have
to carry it around like a dope.

495
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,872
Like a coat check.

496
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:42,545
Oh, don't write it down
unless you like it.

497
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:44,414
Oh, I like it.

498
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:45,681
It seems to me
that the Apple Store

499
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:46,815
is kind of like a party,

500
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,351
so I think our question is,

501
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:49,652
"how do we make this
a better party?"

502
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:51,453
No, we sell business tools,

503
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,255
and the stores
need to reflect that.

504
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:54,756
They need to be all business.

505
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,325
Let all the other stores
look like a toy store.

506
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,830
Right, think different
from Apple.

507
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,299
Dwight, is now
a good time to go over

508
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:08,436
what you expect of us?

509
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:14,007
Yes.

510
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,976
What are my expectations
for the group?

511
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,945
I had been given
the responsibility

512
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,780
to manage Stanley,
a solid player.

513
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:21,882
Ryan, who is capable
of surprises.

514
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,916
Erin, an excellent follower.

515
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:27,287
And Kathy, a probably not
totally useless enigma.

516
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:30,156
And, well, Jim.

517
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:34,994
Under the right manager,
that's not a bad team.

518
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,796
<i>Perfectenschlag.</i>

519
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,760
I don't know how I'm going
to live here without you.

520
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:45,727
Me neither.

521
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:47,696
Hey, will you put this coat
on my chair?

522
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,265
I just realized I'm not
going to need it down there.

523
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:51,599
Yes, I will take your coat
and I will keep it with me.

524
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,768
And I will sleep with it,
because it smells like you.

525
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:57,138
No, no, no, no,
just put it on my chair.

526
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,039
- All right.
- Bye.

527
00:20:58,074 --> 00:20:59,140
Bye.

528
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,576
- Call me when you land.
- I will.

529
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,144
Safe travels.

530
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,412
Goodbye.

531
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:06,547
For a very, very long time.

532
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:09,083
Hmm?
Okay.

533
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:15,088
It's only three weeks.

534
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:17,323
All expenses paid.

535
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:18,724
Yeah, Jim's going to be there.

536
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:23,563
That marriage is not good.
Nobody knows better than me.

537
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:25,030
Definitely we will.

538
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:28,267
It's three weeks in Tallahassee.
What else is there to do?
