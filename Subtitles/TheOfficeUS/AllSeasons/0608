1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,400
Welcome,children

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,400
of the scranton industrial
park communities!

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,670
Yay!

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,070
Join your gangster pumpkin

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,410
on his pallet truck of doom.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,740
Don't worry about a thing.

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,280
Rest assured you will see me later!

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,520
We are doing a haunted
house this halloween,

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,090
which is actually kind of spooky,

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,490
because,as legend has it,

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,590
on this very site there used to be

12
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,630
a productive paper company.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,830
I am going to scare these kids so bad.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,800
This is the spookiest
warehouse in the world,kids.

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,640
You don't believe me?

16
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,210
Just take a look.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,650
Scary,huh?

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,720
This is a surgery with...

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,290
An octopus and a burn victim.

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,550
Black widow.

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,850
Leeloo from the fifth element.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,260
Look,nobody told me what
people were,all right?

23
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,330
So label yourselves
or take what you get.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,260
I vant to sell your blood!

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,530
That's really not the
trend in vampires right now.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,900
Here is an old man and a goth dude,

27
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,340
and then the old crone
from drag me to hell.

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,340
I'm a hobo.

29
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,880
I asked for a list.

30
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,250
And a clown.

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,550
I'm jigsaw,idiot.

32
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,880
You're not as scary
as bookface over there.

33
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,550
Yes,I am the popular
social networking site

34
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,060
known as bookface.

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,860
Okay,kids,you all have been so good

36
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,530
and unbelievably patient,

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,200
so I think you are gonna get some candy!

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,230
Yay!

39
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,610
Kids,just remember,

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,350
suicide is never the answer,all right?

41
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,610
Why is christmas the only
holiday that can have a message?

42
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,090
It is the easy way out.

43
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,560
You are not alone.

44
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,360
What the hell is wrong with you?

45
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,960
Who wants candy?

49
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,720
And then,I think I'm going to go

50
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,420
to the garlic festival.

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,460
Sounds like fun.

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,820
You guys would love it.

53
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,190
They have a tcby booth.

54
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,960
- Cool.
- Same stuff you get downtown.

55
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,090
- Mm-hmm. - Do
you like tcby?

56
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,100
Who doesn't?

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,300
I can't believe it's...

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,330
I can't believe it's yogurt.

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,030
Oh,it'll be fun.

60
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,370
I confirmed with raskin design,

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,370
and they're expecting the
both of you in an hour.

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,940
Actually,it's just gonna be me.

63
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,810
They said the both of you.

64
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,040
That's a mistake.

65
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,440
You should give 'em
a call,check that out.

66
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,780
All right. Just clear this up.

67
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,380
Well,there's actually been
a few changes in the company,

68
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,920
and michael and I are
actually at the same level,

69
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,520
so I get... No.

70
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,290
No,why would that be a problem?

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,820
Jim is a good kid.

72
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,130
He can handle a lot,

73
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,530
but sometimes you have
to call in a master.

74
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,660
I,uh...

75
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,500
Why would you date an amateur

76
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,800
when you could date a professional?

77
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,340
Great. See ya then.

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
Wha... What?

79
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,310
They said that they would feel

80
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,910
more comfortable if you came along.

81
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,980
Why don't they just want
you to go by yourself?

82
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,440
Why do they want me to come,too?

83
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,650
I don't understand.

84
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,510
- I absolutely don't understand,either.

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,050
I don't want you to feel

86
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,850
like I'm babysitting you or something.

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
All right.All right.

88
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,320
Let me go get your stroller.

89
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,530
Sure,michael's a good teacher.

90
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,730
A teacher is someone

91
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,100
who stands right next
to you your whole life

92
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,870
and never lets you do anything.

93
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,030
That's what a teacher is,right?

94
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,870
- What are you gonna call him?
- Dave.

95
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,370
- No,what is his name?
- Dave.

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,170
Mr. Borchard. They're very formal.

97
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,040
Yeah,I've spoken to them on the phone.

98
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,480
Yeah,well,this is not the phone.

99
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,310
This is real life,baby,

100
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,910
and you gotta own it.

101
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,450
Is that what you are wearing?

102
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,720
Yes,it is.

103
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,750
And that is the watch
that you are going to wear?

104
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,920
No,it is not.

105
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,420
You should wear this watch.

106
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,960
I will loan it to you.

107
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,220
It is a tankard.

108
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,730
I highly recommend you wear that.

109
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,760
No,thanks.

110
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,060
- They are into
style. - Mm-hmm.

111
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,630
- They are into appearance.
We are selling success.

112
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,630
And paper.

113
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,470
That's sort of secondary.

114
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,640
Nope.

115
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,870
no.

116
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,640
He's trying to
micro-co-manage me.

117
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:45,210
Or co-micromanage... Me.

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
- Here we are outside...
- W.b.

119
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,380
The wilkes-barre industrial park.

120
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,820
Industrial p.

121
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,120
Makin' cold calls.

122
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,150
The two people with the lowest sales

123
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,990
in the quarter have to do them.

124
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,850
**

125
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,360
***

126
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,280
Yeah,I was gonna sing that part.

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,410
I know. Now you don't have to.

128
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,100
Well,except it was gonna
resolve the melody,so...

129
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,080
Now my head hurts.Feels
like I held in a sneeze.

130
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,110
I hate this feeling.

131
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,430
all right.

132
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,150
Hi,any messages?

133
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,260
You're soaking wet.

134
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,330
Oh,well,jim and I got caught

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,130
in a little flash... Rain,

136
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,830
flash winds,flash lightning.

137
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,530
Wow. Sounds scary.

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,100
It was,it was.

139
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,370
And then in an instant,it wasn't.

140
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,140
Why isn't jim wet?

141
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,410
I... Outran it.

142
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,540
I don't think it rained.

143
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,810
My hip would be throbbing.

144
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,110
It rained.

145
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,450
Michael,can I get you
something... A towel,some cocoa?

146
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,650
Nothing.

147
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,650
Cocoa.

148
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,980
I'll just leave that
suit in your office then?

149
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,250
Good. Yep.

150
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,720
Must be nice to have
company on these cold calls.

151
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,190
We're kind of a dynamic duo.

152
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,390
Or trio.

153
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,190
How exciting!

154
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,730
Do you guys know the sex yet?

155
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,700
Oh,no. No.

156
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,200
We're not together.

157
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,100
No,no,no. Definitely not.

158
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,540
Definitely not.

159
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,940
No,we just work together.

160
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,410
Looks like somebody's got
a case of the "definitelys."

161
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,300
Um,michael?

162
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,850
The custodian from raskin
design is on the line.

163
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,250
He said they found your
keys in the kol pond.

164
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,850
O
- kay,thank you.

165
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,420
Did you say kol pond?

166
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,760
Yeah.

167
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,230
Michael,people are asking questions.

168
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,560
Okay,put them on speaker.

169
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,930
Hey,guys,what's goin' on?

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,770
Hey,michael,did you
fall into a kol pond?

171
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,770
Uh,can't really hear you.

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,040
I think we have sort
of a bad connection.

173
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,040
Jim,did michael fall into a kol pond?

174
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,440
It's like michael said.

175
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,480
It was,um,some... Something else.

176
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,750
It was... Okay,this is what it was.

177
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,550
It was these bunch of idiots

178
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,120
that had put a fish tank in the ground

179
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,450
with no cover and no railing.

180
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,450
- So you fell in.
- No!

181
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,820
Maybe I was trying to save
a child that had fallen in.

182
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,090
So a child had fallen in?

183
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,460
Not yet!

184
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,660
That is hilarious.

185
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,430
No,it... Don't. I'm not gonna bump!

186
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,930
I'm not gonna bump,and
it was not hilarious.

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,270
It was very,very terrifying.

188
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,460
Truthfully,it wasn't the way he fell in.

189
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,300
It was how long it took him to get out.

190
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,120
And we'd like to offer you
15% off your first purchase

191
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,660
as our way of welcoming you to the area.

192
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,810
Well,that sounds like
a really nice deal.

193
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,550
Sha-bow.

194
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,300
And I must say,that since
we are a family business,

195
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,060
it's nice to see that you are,too.

196
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,460
Oh! No... Wow!

197
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,040
You thought that... Oh,my gosh.

198
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,520
Oh,definitely not.

199
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,650
My mistake. I'm sorry.

200
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,230
It's okay.

201
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,430
Nah,actually,it's kinda not okay.

202
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,770
Um,I date models.Face models.

203
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,640
My girlfriend,on a
scale of one to gisele,

204
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,040
uh,a nine.

205
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,510
That's... That's good for you.

206
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,280
Anyway,we also have a
special on envelopes.

207
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,020
Pam's carrying our surrogate,

208
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,620
because my girlfriend needed

209
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,750
to keep her figure for fashion week,

210
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,220
so we,uh,we put our baby in pam.

211
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,530
It doesn't matter what pam looks like.

212
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,860
Yeah.

213
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,700
You were way meaner to
me than I was to you.

214
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,500
No,I wasn't,okay?

215
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,600
The very idea of us together

216
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,240
made you burst out laughing

217
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,540
like you just bit into

218
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,010
an adam sandler and jelly sandwich.

219
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,910
You blew the sale,you idiot!

220
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,310
Let me tell you something.

221
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,910
I was never gonna make that sale.

222
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,810
Erin,do we have any of those
clips that hold paper together?

223
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,760
Staples?

224
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,770
Uh,david wallace called.

225
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,920
Oh,he did? What did he say?

226
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,260
He heard you made a big
splash at the meeting.

227
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,590
Oh,my god,that was so mean what
I just said,and I didn't mean it.

228
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,000
It was kevin and
meredith put me up to it.

229
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,390
Okay.

230
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm gonna kill you.

231
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,980
Michael,don't listen to them.

232
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,040
Thank you,stanley.

233
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,280
You just ignore their carping.

234
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,140
Okay.

235
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,150
- Michael!
- Yes?

236
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,930
A carp is both a fish and
a term for complaining.

237
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,390
They're mocking you with wordplay!

238
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,800
Hey,boss,did you find nemo?

239
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,620
I can name pixar movies,too.

240
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,930
Toy story.

241
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,580
Don't you mean kol story?

242
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,300
When you fell in,did you flounder?

243
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,420
Good one,phyllis.

244
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,400
- Michael,flounder is both a kind of a fish...
- I know what a flounder is.

245
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,730
I'm not usually the butt of the joke.

246
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,500
I'm usually the face of the joke.

247
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,420
I wish jim had fallen into that pond.

248
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,790
Then he'd have to put on my
suit,and it would be too short,

249
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,680
and he'd look...

250
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,500
Damn it,he'd still look good.

251
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,600
The most fundamental thing
about sensitivity training

252
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,330
is that you cannot make fun of a person

253
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,320
for something or some action

254
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,460
that they have done that they regret.

255
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,510
Show of hands.

256
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,140
Who here has been kol-ponded?

257
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,420
Who here has been the butt of a joke

258
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,910
that has gone too far?

259
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,570
- Phyllis.
- Michael,you make fun of us every day.

260
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,020
- Uh...
- Yeah,every single day.

261
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,260
You never said anything.

262
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,430
- Uh,we have countless times.
- Well,it is hard to tell the difference

263
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,630
between you guys saying stop
because I want you to stop,

264
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,500
or stop as in,"stop! You're
making me laugh so hard.

265
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,210
"what you're doing is so funny.

266
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,630
"you're on a roll,I am busting a gut.

267
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,360
Stop!"

268
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,950
that's never been the case.

269
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,150
We are going to make a
"do not mock" list,okay?

270
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,040
Anything that we think
might be out of bounds,

271
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,910
we put on this list.

272
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,300
Anything you put on this list,

273
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,460
you cannot be teased about.

274
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,490
Got it?

275
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,150
I'm gonna kick it off.

276
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,890
Let's see what I have
to put on the list.

277
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,950
Right? Okay.

278
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,130
I also have fallen into the fountain

279
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,670
at the steamtown mall.

280
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,550
Okay,who else? Who else?Dwight,come on.

281
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,390
I don't want people
making fun of my nose.

282
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,160
Your nose?

283
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,560
It's too small.

284
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,400
Right.

285
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,570
Oh,my,that is small.

286
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,150
Just write it down,please.

287
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,640
Can you breathe okay?

288
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,210
What keeps your glasses on?

289
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,770
Hey,it's on the list,everybody.

290
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,870
No,I haven't finished writing.

291
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,320
Did you sneeze it off?

292
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,290
That's it! No more.

293
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,520
Okay,who else? Who else?

294
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,710
Everybody's going to get their chance.

295
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,100
I don't want people
making fun of my weight.

296
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,380
Okay,that's too broad.It's
gotta be something else.

297
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,000
How about your stomach?

298
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,720
Yeah?

299
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,140
Meredith?

300
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,260
I don't want to say it out loud.

301
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,680
Okay,fine. Come on up here.

302
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,080
Write it yourself,

303
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,810
and don't sign your name to it,

304
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,540
and nobody look.

305
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,020
Everybody look away.Look away.

306
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,400
Well,I really didn't want
to put it on the board,

307
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,540
but I thought maybe it was
gonna come out somehow,so...

308
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,730
What are you gonna do?

309
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,040
Okay.

310
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,570
That is our sales pitch,

311
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
and we are stickin' to it.

312
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,540
Well,you two are quite the salesmen,

313
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,630
and a very cute couple.

314
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,230
Well,it's...

315
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,470
Thank you. Thank you.

316
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,800
Some couples don't
seem like a good match,

317
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,530
but you two do.

318
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,860
Well,you know.

319
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,190
Yeah,you know,two peas in a pod.

320
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,220
We complete each other.

321
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,880
What can I say? She loves to cook...

322
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,890
He loves to eat.

323
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,270
I love to dance.

324
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,690
I love to watch him dance.

325
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,430
Right,sometimes i'll just dance

326
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,930
for hours in the living room...

327
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,110
And I'll watch him.

328
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,990
And a baby on the way?
You must be so excited.

329
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,700
Mmm. Yes.

330
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,850
Yeah,we are thrilled.

331
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,450
In fact,we spent the whole weekend

332
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,780
researching various birthing coaches.

333
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,830
- Wasn't that fun,honey?
- It was,sweetie.

334
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,540
Oh,I know the best teacher.

335
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,030
Her name's Miss janet.

336
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,430
Yeah,on clearview avenue.

337
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,140
Yeah!Yeah.

338
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,030
This sounds ridiculous,I know,

339
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,020
but some people say that
I eat like a squirrel.

340
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,180
So now you're comparing
yourself to a cute,tiny animal?

341
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,860
Um,michael? Hmm?

342
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,660
The custodian called again.

343
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,730
Apparently,a kol has died.

344
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,950
It's a fish.

345
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,680
They want you to pay for it.

346
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,470
It could have died of
natural causes,though.

347
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,730
Well,they said you stepped on its head.

348
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,010
He did not suffer.

349
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,010
Um,when is the funeral?

350
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,560
Do not mock,oscar. Do not mock.

351
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,520
How much do they want?

352
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,420
$300. What? No.

353
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,000
I could get a fish
for a five-cent worm.

354
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,560
Oh,you're paying way
too much for worms,then.

355
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,280
Who's your worm guy?

356
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,940
Okay,great meeting,everybody. That's it.

357
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,300
No,no. Thank you.

358
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,990
No! We are not done here.

359
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,970
This...

360
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,370
One of the baby books suggests the
best birthing posture is on all fours

361
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,980
like an animal.

362
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,710
I just wish I had a special telephone

363
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,570
so I could find out exactly what
the little soybean wants,right?

364
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,580
Hey,li'l soybean,what do you want?

365
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,370
Right. How do...

366
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,920
It... I felt a kick.

367
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,650
- Oh,that's great.
- Oh,my gosh,like a little magical foot

368
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,140
just high-fived me.

369
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,690
Yeah. Well,that'll happen.

370
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,040
Oh,my gosh.

371
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,320
It's like he's trying to say,

372
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,200
"i love you,too,daddy."

373
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,970
I love you,too.

374
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,250
Sometimes we're so excited,

375
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,990
we forget where we are...

376
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,270
Mmm! Like at a business meeting.

377
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,610
Message received,lil' soybean.

378
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,170
I think you just gotta
ride this one out,man.

379
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,460
No,jim,you don't understand.

380
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,140
Things like this just don't die.

381
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,780
Kids in high school
still call me ponytail.

382
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,000
- No,they don't.
- Yes,they do,jim.

383
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,270
Because of the time I got my ponytail

384
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,590
stuck in the power drill.

385
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,310
Maybe if you make fun of
yourself,it'll all go away.

386
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,670
I want to make fun of you right now.

387
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,230
Really? Do it.

388
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,220
I am a big,stupid goofball.

389
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,670
No,don't do that. You're not.

390
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,310
You're not stupid.

391
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,640
See?

392
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,930
Oh,my god.

393
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,720
Hey,I...

394
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,890
I just want to say

395
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,320
that I cannot believe

396
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,180
that I walked into a kol pond.

397
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,380
I mean,seriously,walk much?

398
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,840
Oh! I should wear a snorkel

399
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,830
to the next business
meeting that I go to.

400
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,690
Michael,you know,when
you think about it,

401
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,820
it's not all your fault.

402
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,810
I mean,who puts a kol pond in a lobby?

403
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,770
Well,you know what?
You're right,phyllis,

404
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,550
but I've been there before.

405
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,300
I've seen that pond.

406
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,860
This is the thing,I
am a world-class moron.

407
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,210
Michael,please,stop it
now.You're embarrassing yourself.

408
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,670
It's okay. We're having fun.

409
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,920
It's actually not the first time
I've been embarrassed by a pond.

410
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,290
Well...

411
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,610
In high school,the
girl's volleyball team

412
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,420
always used to throw
me into the frozen lake.

413
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,250
Four years in a row.

414
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,330
Ha! Ohh! It was freezing!

415
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,910
No,no,no!

416
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,120
Oh,this is even worse.

417
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,570
Couple of weeks ago,I went
to get a new cell phone,

418
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,850
and I wanted one of those packages

419
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,420
where you have the five...
You know,the friends,

420
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,740
friends and family thing?

421
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,860
And the guy was like,"who
are your five friends?"

422
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,640
and I'm like,"uh... "

423
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,710
I didn't even know!

424
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,600
I couldn't even think.

425
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,300
Oh,my god! It was so embarrassing!

426
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,140
That was,well...

427
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,940
I don't even have
jan's cell phone number,

428
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,510
and I hate her!

429
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,450
She won't give it to me.

430
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,760
It's like,oh,well,I guess I'm a loser.

431
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,870
A
loo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ser!

432
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,470
Too far!

433
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,190
God!

434
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,720
Thanks a lot,man.

435
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,100
Thanks for the advice.

436
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,900
Enjoying your nut?

437
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,250
Why?

438
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,650
I'm not mocking.I was
just making an observation

439
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,960
about her... Nut.

440
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,620
I was.

441
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,760
Hey,who wants to watch
michael's pond dive?

442
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,110
My roommate's friend is the
night janitor over there.

443
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,200
He swiped the security tape for me,

444
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,790
and he's bringing it over.

445
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,480
Mmm,you know what?Maybe we
should go easy on michael,guys.

446
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,740
You know,you watch that tape,

447
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,420
and you're gonna have to stay late
for more sensitivity training,so...

448
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,320
We'll stay late.

449
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,310
Well,that went pretty well.

450
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,350
Yeah,I guess.

451
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,360
We got a maybe. Was our first maybe.

452
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,350
Going by the nard-dog
curve,i'd say we nailed it.

453
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,180
If I'm being completely honest,I
could have done without the belly kiss.

454
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,480
You know what? I'm sorry,

455
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,070
'cause in that moment,

456
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,110
I knew I was kissing
your belly too much.

457
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,550
- Yeah,way too much.
- Yeah.

458
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,030
I mean,what the hell was that?

459
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,920
What the heck was that?

460
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,840
When you cried.

461
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,430
Ahh! Try "almost cried," okay?

462
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,530
I just got caught up in the fantasy.

463
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,770
Your fantasy involves

464
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,920
comparison shopping birthing classes?

465
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,830
No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss janet.

466
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,470
I just...

467
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,620
I don't know,it was
fun to role-play,right?

468
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,430
I mean,it's fun for me,

469
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,700
having a wife and a little baby.

470
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,430
I'm so sick of being single.

471
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,070
Well,are you dating anyone?

472
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,320
What do you think of erin?

473
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,050
I mean,she's... She's kinda cool.

474
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,970
You think I can do better?

475
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,940
I gotta get my goin' out on.

476
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,340
Hey,let's watch this thing!

477
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,600
Whoa! Oh,whoa,okay.

478
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,060
Yeah,we're not watching this.

479
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,370
How can we not watch this?

480
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,990
What happened to "do not mock"?

481
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,520
We're not mocking. We're watching.

482
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,490
That will inevitably lead to mocking.

483
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,650
Well,we'll deal with it as it comes.

484
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,300
Is this the tape of me falling?

485
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,230
Yes,put the dvd in.

486
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,840
Open up quicktime.
It starts on the song.

487
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,720
No,use quicktime.
Trust me,I've done this.

488
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,710
Guys,michael can't handle this,

489
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,220
and as your boss,I'm saying
we're not watching it.

490
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,710
No,it's okay. Watch it.

491
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,080
He can't fire all of you.

492
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,160
What are you doing?

493
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,560
It's all right. I can handle it.

494
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,890
No. I am a grown-up,jim.

495
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,370
Shh! It's on.

496
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,820
There they come.

497
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,630
Boom!

498
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,310
Did... Did you see that? See what?

499
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,620
Wait,why'd you stop it?

500
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,300
Oscar,yes,you're right to stop it.

501
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,600
Thank you. Eject it.

502
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,580
Jim,you let michael fall in.

503
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,420
Play it again.

504
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,980
He purposefully leaned
away and let you fall.

505
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,530
Oh,man.

506
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,690
I think when I started to see
you go in,I think I just froze.

507
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,700
I don't think you froze.

508
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,890
It's a killer new dance move.

509
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,010
Do you want to talk in your office?

510
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,700
no.

511
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,630
I didn't ask you.

512
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,030
Would you like to talk?

513
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,040
Judas.

514
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,070
Jim is my enemy,

515
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,000
but it turns out that jim
is also his own worst enemy.

516
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,480
And the enemy of my enemy is my friend,

517
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,600
so jim is actually my friend.

518
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,530
But because he is his own worst enemy,

519
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,400
the enemy of my friend is my enemy,

520
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,790
so actually,jim is my enemy.

521
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,760
But...

522
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,750
I should have grabbed you.

523
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,350
I'm sorry.

524
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,860
Look,I thought I could have
done today's sales call alone.

525
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,040
I mean,I may never be as
good a salesman as you are,

526
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,380
but I at least need the
chance to do the job.

527
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,890
Jim is jealous of me?

528
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,200
Jim is jealous of me.

529
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,420
Hey,what's up,lifeguard?

530
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,090
Oh,jim,I think I'm in your way.

531
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,470
Oscar's a douche.

532
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,240
No,he's all right.

533
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,390
No,he's a...

534
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,410
Yeah,he's all right.

535
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,310
Okay.

536
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,240
- Thanks,michael.
- You're welcome.

537
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,610
Whoa! Almost fell.

538
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,780
Hey,erin,do you mind faxing this for me?

539
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,260
Oh,sure. Wait. Hand
them to me upside down,

540
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,560
so I don't accidentally read them.

541
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,610
Okay.

542
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,860

How did today go by the
way?Did you make any sales?

544
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,950
No,it was a total waste of time.

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,150
Um,it was fun,though,

546
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,990

the day with andy bernard.

He's like the coolest
person I've ever met.

551
