Oh, sorry. He's... He's dressed all in pink.

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,315
Just about. Yeah.

Yeah, Jan, it looks like a check,

00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,750
a piece of paper of some sort. Receipt.
I don't know.

from the Federal Work Opportunity Program

31
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,921
and no one knows what that means.

<i>JAN: We get that money</i>

Wait, why am I a racist?

51
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,342

<i>Michael?</i>

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,958
Why did the convict have to be a black guy?
It is such a stereotype.

58
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,563
I just wish that Josh had made
a more progressive choice,

59
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:20,988
like a white guy

60
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:28,101
who went to prison
for polluting a black guy's lake.

61
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,266
I wonder what he did.

62
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:37,577
In our society a black man can be arrested
for almost anything.

63
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:45,013
He was probably at a sporting event
and saw some people pushing each other

64
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,092
and he intervened.

65
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,924
Why would anyone go to jail for that?

66
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,829
So what we need to do is to forget

67
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,301
about this whole Martin-in-prison thing.

68
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:03,338

about Martin andlor black people.

Terrible things...

176
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,071
It kinda sounds like prison's better
than Dunder Mifflin.

177
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,306
Well, that's not true.

178
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,372
I would so rather be in prison.

179
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,474
PAM: Yeah.
RYAN: Prison sounds great.

180
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,848
No, you would not.

181
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:24,247
This place is not prison. This place...
It's way better than prison.

182
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,522
Baby. Hello, baby.

183
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,720
Here, you want to play with this?

184
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,422
You can't give paper clips to a baby.

185
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,091
He could swallow them.
It's okay. I've got tons of them.

186
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,292
You like that?

187
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,727
(BABBLING)

188
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,231
Pam-a-lama-ding-dong.

189
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,371
Listen, you're cute.
There is no getting around it.

190
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:49,938
So, I don't know if you like country music,
but I was thinking maybe one of these days

191
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,985
we could drive out to a field,
crank up some tunes,

192
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:57,887
smoke a few Macanudos,
maybe even toss a disc around.

193
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,986
(SPEAKING PIG LATIN)
Ut-way ooh-day ooh-yay ink-thay, am-Pay?

194
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,260
Wow. I...

195
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,319
Shh.

196
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,591
Think about it.

197
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,866
I'll hit you back.

198
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:27,418
Wow. That was... Wow.

199
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,187
<i>Okay!</i> Listen up, <i>everybody!</i>

200
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,292
You guys said that prison was better
than this place.

201
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,228
And I heard you loud and clear.

202
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:44,099
So, I am instituting some changes
to make this more like prison.

203
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:48,797
We are going to start
with an hour of outdoor time. So let's <i>go!</i>

204
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,912
Michael, it's freezing out.

205
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,417
I can't feel my toes.

206
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:06,486
Why don't we pump some iron?
Anybody wanna pump up?

207
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,593
What is that, like,
five pounds?

208
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,821
It's two-and-a-half.

209
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,092
I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.

210
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,529
I'm going back inside.
Yeah, it is freaking cold
out here.

211
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:19,628
Anybody wants to stay out,
you've got about 27 minutes of rec time.

212
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,268
Oh, hey, man.
Hey.

213
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,002
Did you have TV in the joint?

214
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,944
Yeah, in the rec room.

215
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,481
Like a 10-inch black and white?

216
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,779
Actually, our TV was bigger than that one.

217
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,645
(SNIGGERING)

218
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,484
<i>MICHAEL: These people don't realize</i>
<i>how lucky they are.</i>

219
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,883
This office is the American dream
and they would rather be in the hole.

220
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,890
Oh, Andy.

221
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,327
I thought of one last tack
you could take with Pam.

222
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,927
Yeah? What?
Quick question. Do you play the guitar?

223
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,233
I play the banjo.

224
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,740
Hold on, let me think about that.
Yes, that'll work.

225
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,801
But can you sing
in a sexy, high falsetto voice?

226
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,805
(SINGING)
<i>You know I can, my man!</i>

227
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:05,976
Yep, that's perfect.

228
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,315
Hey.
Hey.

229
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,987
Maybe I'll get my banjo out of my car.
Perfect.

230
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,923
What is going on?

231
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,426
I'm messing with Andy.

232
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,658
I'm sending him to all the women
in the office with just terrible information

233
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,323
on how to get them to go out with him.

234
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,698
I love it. I want in.
Who's the target?

235
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,741
Oh, you know what? It was gonna be Pam...
Perfect.

236
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,935
But...
But what do I do?

237
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,706
Just give me an assignment.
Oh, you know what, though?

238
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,507
I feel like I
already sicced him on Pam.

239
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,915
We'll give her a break.
Let's think of someone else.

240
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:45,355
All right, everybody, there has been a lot
of name-calling against our office today,

241
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:50,528
corporate maligning, slurring,
much of it coming from one of you,

242
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:57,030
who claims that prison is better than here.

243
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:01,562
And none of us can say, "Boo," because
none of us have ever been to prison.

244
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,606
Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.

245
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,079
Somebody else who has been to prison,

246
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:13,084
who can tell you what it is really like.

247
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,220
I'm Prison <i>Mike!</i>

248
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,481
You know why they call me Prison Mike?

249
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,890
Do you really expect us to believe
you're somebody else?

250
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,863
Do you really expect me to not push you
up against the wall, biatch?

251
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,023
ALL: Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Hey, pass...

252
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,660
All right. Yay, yay, yay, yay.
That's just the way we talk in the clink.

253
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:35,331
Been a lot of fun talk about prison today,
but I am here to scare you straight.

254
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,942
I am here to scare you <i>straight!</i>

255
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,510
In prison you are somebody's bitch.

256
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:49,213
Oh, and you. You, my friend,
would be the belle of the ball.

257
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,855
Don't drop the soap. Don't drop the soap.

258
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,050
Michael, please.

259
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,592
Where did you learn all of this?
Internet.

260
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:03,499
So, not prison.
And prison. It's 50-50. Both.

261
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:08,134
Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying.
It's not like you can go home

262
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,471
and recharge your batteries
and come back in the morning

263
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,376
and be with your friends,
having fun in the office.

264
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,944
What did you do, Prison Mike?

265
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,913
I stole and I robbed

266
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:28,216
and I kidnapped the President's son
and held him for ransom.

267
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,087
That is quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.

268
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,926
And I never got caught, neither.

269
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,159
Well, you were in prison, but...

270
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,828
Prison Mike,
what was the food like in prison?

271
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,374
Gruel sandwiches. Gruel omelets.
Nothing but gruel.

272
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,910
Plus, you can eat your own hair.

273
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,913
Wow. Prison sounds horrible.

274
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,508
Yeah, yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Thanks.

275
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,710
Prison Mike,

276
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,254
what's the very, very worst thing
about prison?

277
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,051
(SOFTLY) Don't encourage him, Dwight.

278
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,353
(SCREAMING) The worst thing about prison
was the Dementors.

279
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,925
They were flying all over the place
and they were scary

280
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,160
and then they'd come down and they'd suck
the soul out of your body and it <i>hurt!</i>

281
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,565
Dementors like in <i>Harry Potter?</i>

282
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,627
No, not <i>Harry Potter.</i>

283
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,838
There are no movies in prison.

284
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,468
This is my point.
You guys got it soft and cushy.

285
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,740
This place is freaking <i>awesome!</i>
The people are awesome.

286
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,715
Your boss is nice.
Everybody seems to get along.

287
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,080
People are tolerant.

288
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,944
People who would jump to conclusions
can redeem themselves.

289
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,690
Nobody is nobody's bitch.

290
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,751
I hope that this scared you,
and from me, Prison Mike to you,

291
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:42,529
I just wanna thank you for listening to me
and letting me be a part of your life today.

292
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:49,173
'Cause you got a good <i>life!</i>
You got a good life, a good life.

293
00:16:56,048 --> 00:17:00,417
So what do you think?
It doesn't sound so great, does it?

294
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,684
Wow. Thank you.

295
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,193
That must have been hard for you
to relive that. Both of you.

296
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:14,297
Yeah, that wasn't really at all my experience.

297
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,462
There's certain elements
of what you performed

298
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,499
I've seen on television,

299
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,002
but it didn't remind me of my time in prison.

300
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,442
Okay. Okay, fine.

301
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,980
You guys think prison is so great. All right.

302
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,378
Well, here you go.

303
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,279
KEVIN: Okay, Michael,
come on, let us out.

304
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,322
<i>No!</i> If you think prison is so wonderful,
then enjoy prison.

305
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,158
Are we gonna...
They are such babies.

306
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,288
I am going to leave them in there

307
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,994
until they can appreciate
what it's like to have freedom.

308
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,799
And if this doesn't bother them,
then I am out of ideas.

309
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,102
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

310
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,938
KEVIN: Hey, let us out of here.

311
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,812
(HUMMING A LULLABY)

312
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,507
<i>Hey!</i> I have...
Shh.

00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,784
(PHONE RINGING)

314
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,714
This is Toby.

315
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,581
Hey, Pam.

316
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,416
Where're you calling from?

317
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,232
Michael, why is everyone locked
in the conference room?

318
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,395
They were very disrespectful to me
and to the office

319
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,599
and Martin has had a bad influence.

320
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,471
To think that I gave him
the benefit of the doubt. It's...

321
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,939
Well, you're gonna have to let them out,
or I will, okay?

322
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,278
You know what, Toby?
I am teaching them a lesson, so...

323
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,479
You know they're teasing you.

324
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:51,161
I mean, obviously this is a much nicer place
than an actual prison.

325
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,695
We get paid to be here.

326
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,995
We go home afterwards
and have social lives.

327
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,162
And we have parties here.

328
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,071
They're teasing you to be funny.

329
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,018
Okay, nutcases, get out of there.

330
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:21,951
Good work. Long day. Really long.
Why don't you guys head home early.

331
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,663
Time off for good <i>behavior!</i>

332
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,666
Good job. Enjoy your freedoms.

333
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:41,409
Martin went from being a new guy
from Stamford

334
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:47,518
<i>to the convict, to my friend,</i>
<i>back to a convict,</i>

335
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:53,556
<i>then to kind of a nuisance, actually,</i>
<i>if we could be completely honest,</i>

336
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:59,353
<i>and finally, to a quitter.</i>
<i>And I will not miss him.</i>

337
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,765
And that is not because he is black.

338
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:12,469
(SINGING IN FALSETTO) <i>So we've been told</i>
<i>and some choose to believe it</i>
