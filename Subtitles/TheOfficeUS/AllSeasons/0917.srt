00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:55,329
We're at a funeral.
There's a funeral going on here.

181
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,047
- Okay.
- Okay.

182
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:59,399
- Anyone mention her height?
- Yep.

183
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:03,287
Land size?

184
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:06,089
Shirley, at 1,600 acres,

185
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:08,091
you have the largest farm
in the area,

186
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:10,727
sharing borders
with six other farms

187
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:14,998
including my own farm
and your nephew Dwight's.

188
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,702
Okay.

189
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:25,125
So... let's get it going.

190
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,194
Would you want to do
the honors?

191
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:28,812
Oh, right, uh...

192
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,881
you know, I-I don't think
we have to do this.

193
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,833
We Schrutes don't need
some Harvard doctor

194
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,302
to tell us
who's alive and who's dead.

195
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:39,289
But there was an unlucky streak
of burying some heavy sleepers.

196
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:41,975
And when grave robbers
discovered some scratch marks

197
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,394
on the inside of some
of the coffins,

198
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:48,215
we decided to make sure that
our dead were completely dead...

199
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:49,783
out of kindness.

200
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:54,538
[Rifle cocks]

201
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:55,572
[Gunshot]

202
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:58,392
That's it for me.

203
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:01,911
I don't think
we should eat Packer's cupcakes.

204
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:03,363
We can't give him
the satisfaction.

205
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:04,848
I agree.

206
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,767
Even though that place has
a way of making those cupcakes

207
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:08,935
so they're dense
but they're also really fluffy.

208
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,304
We can't let him buy
our forgiveness with cupcakes.

209
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,223
He was awful to us.

210
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:15,158
And he still is.

211
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:17,394
How much is a cupcake,
2.50?

212
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:18,829
Is that the price
of our dignity?

213
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:22,733
3.75 a cupcake actually,
3.67 if you buy a dozen.

214
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,067
I never forget a number.

215
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:25,986
Names, in one ear
and out the other.

216
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:29,723
Places, nope.
Faces, that's rich.

217
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:31,358
But numbers...

218
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:33,527
I have a gift.

219
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:35,729
I guess that's why
I'm an accountant.

220
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:38,999
Hey, man,
I don't think we've met.

221
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,917
- I'm Clark.
- Oh, I'm Todd.

222
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:44,888
Oh, sorry for calling you
a fat little runt earlier.

223
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:47,207
You didn't actually say that.

224
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,575
- No?
- No.

225
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:50,210
Wow!

226
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:51,694
I'm in this mode now

227
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:53,146
where I'm apologizing for
thoughts that are in my head.

228
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,132
Hmm.
[Forced chuckle]

229
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,566
Hey!

230
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,236
I have a crazy feeling...

231
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,988
that you are really
gonna like this.

232
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:03,724
Maybe we should
eat the cupcakes.

233
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:05,842
Haven't we done enough
to Packer?

234
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,078
I mean, we sent him down
to Florida on a prank,

235
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:09,329
and you did fire him.

236
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:10,697
I did.
I did, yes.

237
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,933
And it was purely political.
He did nothing wrong.

238
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,301
Would any of you be saying
any of this

239
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:15,786
if the cupcakes were
from Supermart?

240
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,571
Do they even
have a bakery anymore?

241
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,156
They do.
It's awful!

242
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,475
And it's getting worse
every day.

243
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:24,094
So it really is
just about the cupcakes.

244
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:25,762
Wow, you're right.

245
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:27,848
It is just about the cupcakes.

246
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:31,368
So we're all agreed
no one touches those cupcakes?

247
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,221
- Okay.
- Okay.

248
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:36,423
Packer can go to hell.

249
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:41,211
Thank you for coming
to my funeral.

250
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:44,181
As I gaze at life's big sunset,

251
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:47,417
I can't help but wonder
where it all went wrong.

252
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:50,821
You've all disappointed me
greatly.

253
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:53,540
Fanny, a single mama
in the city.

254
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:54,691
Thank you.

255
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,043
Jeb, a street pusher.

256
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:58,328
After I left the army,

257
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:00,630
I bought a nine-acre
worm farm

258
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:01,915
from a Californian.

259
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,901
Turns out,

260
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:08,038
"worm" means something else
out there,

261
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:12,559
and I am now
in the business of...

262
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:14,878
pain management.

263
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:19,049
Or the smoking
of pain management.

264
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,951
I can't stand the fact
that Jeb is a pot farmer.

265
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:23,804
He could've grown anything.

266
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:25,755
Anything in the world.

267
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:29,309
He used to talk about
growing a peanut-grape hybrid.

268
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:32,462
One plant, one sandwich.

269
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,147
We can't just sit by

270
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:37,300
and watch our family farm
disappear.

271
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:39,102
So here are my terms.

272
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:40,970
Dwight, Fanny, Jeb.

273
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:46,993
If you come back home,
I will leave you my farm.

274
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:49,663
- So there you have it.
- Is she crazy?

275
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:51,414
- Dwight?
- Dwight? Buddy?

276
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:52,699
- No, no, no.
- Snap out of it.

277
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,983
[Snapping fingers] Dwight!

278
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,890
Let's do this.

279
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,025
Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm.

280
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,276
I'm in.
Boom!

281
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,661
No, no, no.
I'm not moving back here.

282
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:03,029
- Are you crazy?
- Of course you are.

283
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:05,114
Look, I don't wanna be mean
or, like, insulting.

284
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:06,582
I know that you like it here.

285
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:09,952
But, Dwight, it's just that
farm life lacks a certain...

286
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:12,255
- sort of sophistication...
- Oh, my God.

287
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:13,639
That Cami and I are drawn to.

288
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:15,007
and...

a willing ignorance.

Yes, I--
thank you for asking me.

292
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:26,452
I actually have written
a little bit of poetry.

293
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,806
That's crazy.
And I was recently published.

294
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:31,491
Which is just--

295
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:32,825
maybe I have--
yep, I do.

Let's take a couple of nights

307

and stay here and think
about Aunt Shirley's offer.

00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,150
Couple of nights couldn't hurt.

309
00:12:57,184 --> 00:12:58,951
Oh, somehow I think
a couple of nights could hurt.

310
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,069
You will say yes on one.

311
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,171
5, 4, 3, 2.

312
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:03,806
Get ready to say yes.
One!

313
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:07,693
- Yes!
- Absolutely!

314
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,146
Growing up with Dwight
and Mose was not easy.

315
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,982
Uh, Dwight was obviously
the cool one,

316
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,034
and Mose was the visionary,

317
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:18,671
which left me
to be the comedian.

318

- Kevin, you can do this.
- You don't know that.

354
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:15,054
Kevin, um, let's think
of something to distract us.

355
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:16,755
Like the movie <i>Skyfall.</i>

356
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:18,474
You loved the movie <i>Skyfall,</i>
<i>right?</i>

357
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,042
Mm-hmm.

358
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:21,577
James Bond was a spy.

359
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:24,213
- Yes, he was a good spy.
- Yeah.

360
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:25,698
He was the best.

361
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:28,367
James Bond
would love this cupcake.

362
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:29,669
Hey, you know what,

363
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:32,521
it was great
to see you all again.

364
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,558
Take care.

365
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:40,713
I am going through
a 12-step program.

366
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:43,299
I'm currently on step zero...

367
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,319
which is have a shitload
of fun.

368
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:48,671
I spent six hours

369
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:51,424
carefully removing the frosting

370
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,542
and then layering in
a variety of drugs,

371
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:55,127
some legal, some not...

372
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:58,281
some laxative,
some constipating.

373
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:01,317
You don't fire The Packman...

374
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,970
and expect to get away with it.

375
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,806
Guys, I'm proud of us.

376
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,343
I think we did the right thing.
Hey!

377
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:12,378
- What, Pam?
- Wait!

378
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:14,480
He's gone.
It's just a cupcake now.

379
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,816
No, no!
It's the principle of the thing.

380
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,101
Oh, my God.

381
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:21,854
I forgive him so much.

382
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:23,572
[Gagging]

383
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,658
- Whoa! Is he choking?
- Kevin?

384
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:28,327
[Coughing]

385
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,272
Oh, that was fantastic.

386
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,638
Is it dangerous to take
the eggs in front of them?

387
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:50,982
Yes, very.
You really need to stand back.

388
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:52,917
'Cause these
are killer chickens.

389
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:55,470
I was just asking you
something I didn't know.

390
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:57,822
Which is fine,
and you learned something.

391
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:59,290
But it was kind of
a stupid question,

392
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:01,292
so you're gonna get made fun of
a little bit.

393
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,884
Are we gonna eat these today?

394
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:10,985
If you want.

395
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,008
Is that a guillotine?

396
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,392
This? No.

397
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:19,827
That'd be cool though.

398
00:17:19,862 --> 00:17:22,513
It's for milking.

399
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:26,551
That's a cow?

400
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,319
Did you just ask me
if this was a cow?

401
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:32,990
What are you doing now?

402
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,876
Come here.

403
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,943
Come on.

404
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:38,429
[Milk squirting into bucket]

405
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,066
Grab a teat with each hand.
Sit down.

406
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,187
There you go.
Squeeze from top to bottom.

407
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:47,488
Really pull, use some muscle.

408
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:50,708
Draw the milk out.
All right, going all right?

409
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:52,410
I don't know.

410
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:56,597
Well, is the udder hot?
Is the milk clumpy?

411
00:17:56,615 --> 00:17:58,399
- I don't know any of that.
- Okay, you suck at this.

412
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:01,702
Gimme those teats.
[Clears throat]

413
00:18:02,654 --> 00:18:04,739
Didn't your father
teach you anything?

414
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:08,576
I never met him.

415
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:10,511
Good morning, Erin.

416
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:12,213
Hey.

417
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,351
Hey, everybody.

418
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:21,188
Um, I decided to eat
my cupcake.

419
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:22,390
I thought about it last night.

420
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:23,758
I talked to Jim,
I talked to my sister,

421
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:27,028
and I think that as long
as Todd Packer doesn't know,

422
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:28,529
it's okay.

423
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:31,165
I don't care what you do, Pam,
just please stop making noise.

424
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:32,233
Phyllis!

425
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,985
Packer laced the cupcakes.

426
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,236
No!

427
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,937
Did you get diarrhea
or were you stoned?

428
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:39,206
- Some of us got both.
- Oh, my God!

429
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:40,541
Is everyone okay?

430
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,760
Last night,
I got out all of my old dolls

431
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,779
and played with them
on the living room floor.

432
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:48,666
Then I ordered ten
American Girl outfits on line.

433
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:51,018
It was thousands of dollars.

434
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:53,738
Well, count yourself lucky,
Phyllis.

435
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,573
[Whispering] I got the toilet.

436
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:56,857
Me too.

437
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,760
I went Christmas caroling...
in March,

438
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:01,812
and I fertilized some bushes
along the way.

439
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,731
So not my best night.

440
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:05,499
But not my worst night.

441
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:07,802
[Sighs] What did you do, Andy?

442
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,506
Last night!

443
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,075
Oh, God, um...

444
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:17,061
I don't know.
Noth-nothing, really.

445
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:19,647
- Kevin?
- Why would you ask me?

446
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:21,499
No, I'm not a--
I just-- I don't know.

447
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,117
[Both screaming]

448
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:25,886
Oh... gosh,
I actually--

449
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:28,422
it is hard to recall.

450
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:32,326
Um, pretty normal night.

451
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:36,047
My night was just like that...

452
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:37,765
- Yup.
- Okay.

453
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,769
[Pants tearing] Meaning normal.

454
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,738
Yeah, I didn't see you
last night at all.

455
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:45,773
Nope, I did not see you either.

456
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,291
[Kevin groans loudly]

457
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:53,147
Wow! He is officially
the worst human being.

458
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:55,683
Ah!

459
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:57,551
But... Kevin, that's--

460
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:59,854
Yeah, no, I understand, Pam.

461
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:01,388
I understand.

462
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:03,991
No. Ohh.

463
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:08,562
So that's it.
I just wanted to make amends.

464
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:13,584
- Wow.
- That's big of you, man.

465
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:14,952
Takes a lot of courage.

466
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:17,538
Ooh.
Red velvet.

467
00:20:17,572 --> 00:20:18,839
I should apologize too.

468
00:20:18,874 --> 00:20:20,791
It's okay.

469
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:22,960
I'm over it.

470
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,560
♪ When we arrive,
sons and daughters... ♪

471
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:43,647
Ooh, this is
no nine-acre worm farm.

472
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:45,649
This is a beast.

473
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:47,768
Whoever's managing this thing
is gonna have a hell of a job.

474
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:49,320
Mm-hmm.

475

- Not it.
- Not it.

476
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:54,075
It.

477
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:00,247
If your kid doesn't put in
some farm time,

478
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,949
or he's gonna stay like that.
