1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,333
What's this?

2
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,840
Looks like a red wire.

3
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,036
Well...

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,241
It wasrt here before.

5
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,811
It's a computer, Dwight.
I mean, computers have wires.

6
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,412
Yours doesn't.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,380
Doesrt it?

8
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,686
No.

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,460
It's going in
a different direction
than the other wires.

10
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,055
Dwight, I'm really busy.
I can't talk about this
anymore.

11
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,208
(RIPPING)

12
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,774
Dwight,
get out of here.
Just shut up, Phyllis.

13
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,482
STANLEY:
What are you doing?

14
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:12,201
I got 500 feet of
red wire at a flea market
out by Dunmore High School.

15
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,730
Twenty bucks for
the whole spool.

16
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,569
Crazy. What a deal.

17
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,642
Oh! He'll be fine.
I made it up there.

18
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,351
What you talking
'bout, Wallace?

19
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,909
DAVID: Hi, Michael.
How are you?
Hi.

20
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,045
I'm well. How are you?

21
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,248
Very good.

22
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,484
So, listen,
as you know,

23
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,719
we haven't yet filled
the Regional Supervisor job.

24
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,694
Oh, have you not?
Correct.

25
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,993
And I was wondering
if I could get you to do
some of the fieldwork

26
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,694
that would normally go
to the supervisor.

27
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,999
Okay. There's an area
from Carbondale
to Marshbrook...

28
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,733
Yeah.
...where we've never
done any business.

29
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,241
There's a small company
there, Prince Paper.

30
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,503
I can't get
a report on it

31
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,636
because it's not
a public company,

32
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,908
but we've been
talking about going
after their market,

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,950
so I was hoping
you could do some
fact-finding for me.

34
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,143
Okay.

35
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,186
I'll fax over some
of the things we're
looking for, okay?

36
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,916
Fax? Why don't you just
send it over on a dinosaur?

37
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,549
(CHUCKLES)

38
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,683
This is important,
Michael.

39
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,954
Oh! Well, then
e-mail it, David.

40
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,123
You've got no taste,
Stanley Hudson.

41
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,665
Oh, I do.

42
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,893
What are you guys
talking about?

43
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,764
Some actress,
whether she's hot.

44
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,634
Who's the gal
in question?

45
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,966
Hilary Swank.

46
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,439
Ah! Hilary Swank.

47
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,234
Not at all.

48
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,710
She's got mean eyes.

49
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,144
Have you seen her
with her bangs?

50
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,647
She looks like
a monster.

51
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,343
Guys, she is
a beautiful movie star,

52
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,409
so maybe we should
just go to work.

53
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,614
She is an
amazing actress.

54
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,657
That's not the question.
She's not hot.

55
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,521
Yeah. Thank you, Phyllis.
JIM: Okay, okay, okay.

56
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,185
Why don't we just
put this to a vote,

57
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,592
and then we'll be
done with it?

58
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,392
I'm not voting.
No one cares.

59
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,558
Who thinks that
Hilary Swank is hot?
Raise your hand.

60
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:27,128
Okay, and who thinks that
Hilary Swank is not hot?
Raise your hand.

61
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,304
Five. Five to five.

62
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,936
Thank you,
accounting department.

63
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,605
So, what do we do now?

64
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,215
What if the owner
of Prince Family Paper
has a beautiful daughter,

65
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,309
and we have to
seduce her in order
to get their secrets?

66
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,444
I will seduce her.

67
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,852
No, I want to seduce her.
I'll seduce her.

68
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,083
Let me seduce her.
Michael, please.
No, no, no. I got it.

69
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,086
You'll fall in love
with her.

70
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,856
Yeah? So what if I did?

71
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,329
That would take
precedence, and I would
expect your support.

72
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,491
Okay, so let's go over
the plan again.

73
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,502
All right. I am
a local business owner.
Mmm-hmm.

74
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,559
I need to buy paper.
Yep.

75
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,663
I find out everything
about their prices
and policies.

76
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,674
Your fictitious name?
Michael Scarn.

77
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,643
Good. I am
a paper salesman
looking for a new job.

78
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,907
I find out everything
about their expenses
and salaries.

79
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,471
Okay.
Then we meet
at the Denny's,

80
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,109
and we compare notes.
No. No. I never
said Denny's. IHOP.

81
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,743
No. I said Denny's.
IHOP. We're going to IHOP.

82
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,981
You know how
I feel about IHOP.
Don't start.

83
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,113
Don't...
You know what?
Socialist.

84
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,454
I don't want to get
into this debate again.
Okay.

85
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,514
I enjoy IHOP.

86
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,617
I'll have
a cup of coffee.

87
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,924
You will have pancakes,
and you'll like it.

88
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,434
The store next to
them is for lease.

89
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,667
So what?

90
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,539
It means they're
not expanding.

91
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,373
Maybe they're
shrinking.
No.

92
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,709
They could be shrinking.
No, because the
sign is centered

93
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,545
perfectly above their store.
No sign of the sign
being moved.

94
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,709
Ah-ha!

95
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,911
Yep.

96
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,780
DWIGHT: It's lunch-time,
but no sign of anyone
coming in or out,

97
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,357
which means they're not
taking new customers
out to lunch,

98
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,758
which means they're not
acquiring new business,

99
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,318
so once again,
no growth.

100
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,389
Yeah.
There are clouds,
clouds in the sky.

101
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,060
Means it's going to rain.
Bad for business.

102
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,900
It would if
they were altocumulus
and not cirrostratus.

103
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,269
Why do... Okay.

104
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,398
Michael.
Whatever.

105
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,567
Get your clouds right.
Shut up.

106
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,305
Okay, so you go in now.
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,937
I'm gonna go in,
in exactly 10 minutes.

108
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,812
We have never met each other.
We are complete strangers.

109
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,215
Right.
Also, we're going
to need a signal

110
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,378
to bolt out of there,
in case there is danger.
Fine.

111
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,321
And that signal is
lick your lips.
Try it.

112
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,186
No, no, no, like this.

113
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,925
Good.

114
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:36,993
Ready to do this?
Yeah.

115
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,436
All right,
here come the sharks.

116
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,007
(BOTH SINGING JAWS THEME)

117
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,955
MICHAEL: In nature,
there is something
called the food chain.

118
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,122
It is where the shark
eats the little shark,

119
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,666
and the little shark eats
the littler shark,

120
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,224
and so on
and so on and so on,

121
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,271
until you get down to
the single-cell shark.

122
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,796
So, now replace sharks
with paper companies,

123
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,866
and that is all
you need to know
about business.

124
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,377
MICHAEL: Hello?
Hello.

125
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,915
Hello.
Hi.

126
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,549
Hi.
How can I help you?

127
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,483
My name is Michael Scarn.

128
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,353
I am a local
business owner,

129
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,017
and I would like
to find out about
your company.

130
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,857
Please come in.
Thank you.

131
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,326
What kind of business
are you in?

132
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,663
We're a law firm.

133
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,432
I assume your
primary paper needs are
stationery, general office.

134
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,100
You know,
I'll be honest with
you about something.

135
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,705
Where I used to live,
our paper supplier had
a lot of big clients,

136
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,214
and I just didn't
feel like a priority.

137
00:06:56,282 --> 00:07:01,242
So I guess my question
to you would be,

138
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,621
how many clients
do you have?

139
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,414
About 80.

140
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,356
Really? That many?

141
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,395
This doesn't seem like
a very big operation.

142
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,693
Well, it's just me,
my wife and my son.

143
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,223
Ah! So, when did
you set up shop?

144
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,862
I opened this place
after I came back
from Vietnam.

145
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,031
Ooh, Vietnam.
I hear it's lovely.

146
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,766
Mmm.

147
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,638
ANDY: Each side will have
three minutes to prepare
opening arguments.

148
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,543
Topic. Hilary Swank
is attractive.

149
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,741
ALL: Hot.
Hot.

150
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,977
The debate is
whether she's hot.

151
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,211
What difference
does it make?

152
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,880
Attractive, hot, beautiful.
We're talking about
the same thing here.

153
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,516
Huge difference.
A painting can be
beautiful,

154
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,059
but I don't want
to bang a painting.

155
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,822
Okay. TMI.

156
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,654
So, even specialty paper,
say 94 brightness,
double-bonded,

157
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,565
you would put that on
the same truck as your
conventional stock?

158
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,336
You sure know
a lot about paper
for a lawyer.

159
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:56,771
Oh! Well, that is
because I am a genius.

160
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,571
(CHUCKLING) Oh, really?
Yes.

161
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:03,274
Well, about some things,
and other things I'm just...
I'm very stupid.

162
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,114
Like, watch this.
Is this the cup?

163
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,084
Is this the cup?
Is this what
I drink out of?

164
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,885
(LAUGHING)

165
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,552
Laughter is my job.

166
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,759
Tears are my game.
Law is my profession.

167
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,429
Well...
DWIGHT: Hello.

168
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,933
I'd like to apply
for a job.

169
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,127
Hi.

170
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,137
I'm afraid we're
not hiring right now.

171
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,373
Why don't you just
get rid of this guy?

172
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,867
ROGER: (LAUGHS)
That's my son.

173
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,605
I'm your son now.
You can visit him
on holidays.

174
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,907
Dwight Schrute.

175
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,107
I'm a paper salesman at
a second-tier paper company
called Dunder Mifflin.

176
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,051
I'm the top salesman there,
and I'm looking for
a new challenge.

177
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,546
I would say you guys
have, what,

178
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,518
40 high-volume clients?

179
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,785
Try 80.

180
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,856
(LAUGHS) Eighty,
that's nothing.

181
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,089
I've got 90 clients
myself.

182
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,429
Better look out.
Someone might run you
out of business.

183
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,899
Well, I sure hope not.

184
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,060
(BOTH LAUGHING)

185
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,125
Me, too.

186
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:03,136
I think all of us have
a tendency to view celebrities
as sort of mythical figures.

187
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,574
You know,
we don't really
see them as real,

188
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,772
so, therefore,
we don't judge them
as real people.

189
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,941
Are you serious?
Jim, just show us
a picture.

190
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,712
Kevin, come on.
KELLY: Yeah, shut up, Kevin.

191
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,049
No, but he's making
all these fancy...

192
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,617
It's a gut thing.

193
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,624
That's fair.
You know what, Kev?
Do me a favor.

194
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,216
Why don't you
close your eyes?

195
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,796
Okay.

196
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,729
Now, imagine that
Hilary Swank comes into
this office for real.

197
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,367
She walks over to you
and she says,

198
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,031
"Kevin Malone,
I just read your
online profile,

199
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,506
"and there's nothing I'd
rather do than make out
with you right now."

200
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,140
Now, you tell me something,
is she hot?

201
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,315
(ALL CHEERING)

202
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,888
Does that end the debate
or is there...
Oh!

203
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,158
Hey, Kev,
what are you doing?

204
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:03,827
Nope. It's, "Is she hot?"
Not, "Would you do her?"

205
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,063
Respect the game.

206
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,799
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

207
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:08,862
This close.

208
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,305
So why are you considering
leaving Dunder Mifflin?

209
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,039
My boss.
(LAUGHING)
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

210
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,674
His insensitivity could
border on the cruel.

211
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,312
This is a man
who does not listen to
the needs of his underlings.

212
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,444
Hey!
He's way...

213
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,217
Hey, how's the
interview going?

214
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,384
It's going very well.
Don't blow it.

215
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,585
Hey, Linda, can I get
a picture of you?

216
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,095
You want a picture of me?
I would.

217
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,224
Could you just
stand right over here?

218
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,930
That would be great.
Just something to
remember the trip by.

219
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,441
Just a little
to your left.

220
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,100
There you go. Good.

221
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,071
Perfect.

222
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,578
Can I have
a copy of that?

223
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,807
Um...

224
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,780
Grandma, I can't do this.

225
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,249
What's going on?
A little homework
over here?

226
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,186
Yeah.
Let's see if I can help.

227
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,348
Right there.

228
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,824
Oh! Math.
That's not so hard.

229
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,228
Okay. There are
four of these.
All right.

230
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,263
Ignore the parentheses,
right?

231
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,630
Right.
Why is this little 2
so small?

232
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,861
It's weird.
You just don't...
Just go by the "X."

233
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:19,810
The "X" means times,
so that means
four times "X," 2.

234
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,810
What is double 4?

235
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,842
Eight.
Right. Excellent.

236
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,680
(WHOOPS)
Way to go. Nice.

237
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,183
(GIGGLES)

238
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,446
Don't put that.

239
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:36,117
Ladies and gentlemen,
even though the penis
was fake,

240
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,028
I kept expecting
a second plot twist

241
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:43,228
where we found out
that Hilary Swank
actually was a boy.

242
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,129
Kevin.
Okay.

243
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,264
I wasrt going to dignify
this discussion by getting
involved,

244
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,338
and I don't even
get the discussion.

245
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,070
Hot is a temperature,
people.

246
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,776
But Kevin
deserves to lose
for what he said.

247
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,716
So, yes, she's hot.
She's hot as heck.

248
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,680
She's a female
Boris Becker.

249
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,386
(EXCLAIMS)

250
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,045
JIM: All right.

251
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,922
Well, thank you very much
for all of your help.

252
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,855
It's going to be
an incredibly
hard decision.

253
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,895
Wait. Let me get
something for you here.

254
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:17,367
Here's some references.
Our top clients.

255
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:22,001
You call any of them.
I trust you'll hear
some good things.

256
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,673
Okay. Okay. Okay.

257
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,306
All right, thank you.

258
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,473
(CHUCKLING)
You're welcome.

259
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,543
Excuse me, sir.
Mmm-hmm?

260
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,111
I took the bus here
and was wondering

261
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,282
if I could
catch a ride home
with you in your car.

262
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,451
Of course.
Thank you very much.

263
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,892
Thanks for your time.
Thank you very much.

264
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,987
Thank you for your time.
I cannot wait to
contact your clients.

265
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,861
I'll look forward
to getting your calls.

266
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,923
ROGER: All right.
Bye now. So long.

267
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,463
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

268
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,431
We struck
the mother lode.

269
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,239
Come on!
Wallace is gonna freak.

270
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,972
He is going to
absolutely freak.
All their top clients.

271
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,479
I can't believe it.
Someone's looking out
the window.

272
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,142
Go, go, go.
Go, peel out! Go!

273
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,013
Shoot.
What the...

274
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,350
Okay, I'll just...
I know.
You drove over the...

275
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,821
I know. I know. Oh!
Go back.

276
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,483
God, what was that?
That's not good.

277
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,665
Oh, come on.
Yes!

278
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,726
No, no, no.
She's hot, okay?

279
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,967
Because if you are saying
that Hilary Swank isn't hot,

280
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,667
then you're saying
I'm not hot,

281
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,870
because obviously
I'm not as hot
as Hilary Swank!

282
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,204
Oh.
MICHAEL: Darn it.

283
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,716
Oh, come on.
Oh, man.

284
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,543
My car.
ROGER JR: Are you all right?

285
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,917
DWIGHT: Not good.
Is everyone okay?

286
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,819
Yeah.
LINDA: It sounded bad.

287
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,619
No, no, no. We're fine.
We're fine.
DWIGHT: Yeah.

288
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,989
You folks have done
enough already.
You don't...

289
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,721
You've done more than
you could possibly know.

290
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,695
(SHUSHING)
Dwight, just...
Okay.

291
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,789
You know,
we're just gonna call
a tow truck, so...

292
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,926
No, a tow truck is gonna
charge you 100 bucks
just to take you a mile.

293
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,765
Let me take a look.
No. No.

294
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,897
You know,
really not necessary.
He drove over the divider,

295
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,031
and then backed over it.
MICHAEL: Dwight.

296
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,472
It caught the bumper.
I'll be right back.

297
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,975
I'm just gonna
grab my toolbox.

298
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,306
Don't...

299
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:13,510
Ladies, are we prepared to
let the Kevins of the world
decide anything for us?

300
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,787
Anything at all?
We don't even give him
full Internet access.

301
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,983
Wait, what?

302
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,594
See that? The obvious
symmetry of the face.

303
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:30,425
This is a natural appeal
of the scientific standard
of koinophilia,

304
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,439
features that are
a composite average
of many features.

305
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,468
Yes, she's attractive,
but she's not hot.

306
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,712
(MEN CHATTERING)

307
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,644
How much longer
is this gonna take?
Put that over there.

308
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,148
You know,
let me give you
some money for this.

309
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,376
No. I sit all day.

310
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,885
It's nice working
with my hands.
Well, I...

311
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:53,852
Oh! Coffee.
That's too much nice.

312
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:54,950
ROGER: Maybe
not enough oil.

313
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,790
Thank you.
You're welcome.

314
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,587
Ah. Disgusting.
What is this? Instant?

315
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,527
Well, that ought to do it.
Okay.

316
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,465
It's all better.
Thank you.

317
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,196
Gosh, well, so long.

318
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,768
Bye-bye.
That looks great.

319
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,670
(LAUGHS) Drive safe.
REBECCA: Bye.

320
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,539
Look forward to hearing
from you about that
job application.

321
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,407
Bye.
Okay.

00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,037
Goodbye, Prince family.

for you and sharpen your
teeth while I'm at it."

No, it's...

329
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,005
All I'm saying is Kevirs
not necessarily a feminist.

330
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,276
That's all I'm saying.
What are you...

(EXHALES)

332
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,055
Dwight, what will
happen to that family

333
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,526
if I call Wallace
and give him
this information?

334
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,861
It's simple.
Wallace would use that
information to destroy them.

00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,229
(SIGHING) Okay.

336
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,865
You know,
our sales are fine.
Well.

337
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,767
We're doing fine.
They're doing fine.

338
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,465
Could be better.
Why don't we just live
and let live?

339
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,303
What?
Live and let live.

340
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,501
I'm not familiar
with that expression.

341
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,941
It's a James Bond...

342
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,103
It doesn't make
any sense.
Okay.

343
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,203
Of course I'm alive.

344
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,477
I'm not going
to make this call.
Michael, you have to.

345
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,847
Have you ever seen
a lioness devour
her cub?

346
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,579
Oh, God, not this.
Have you ever seen a baboon

347
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,450
devour its mate?

348
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,011
Have you ever seen
a raccoon devour
a squirrel?

349
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,285
My heart...
My heart says no.

350
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,657
Your heart
is a wonderful
thing, Michael.

351
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,355
But it makes some
terrible decisions.

352
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,453
That's true.

353
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,293
Yes. Gosh.
That's true.

354
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,460
It has gone down
the wrong path
many, many times.

355
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,729
Jan, Ryan.

356
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,395
Yeah, save your
heart for love.

357
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,635
And use your brain
for business. Right?

358
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,871
If we don't do this
to Prince Paper,
then someone else will.

359
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,982
Or worse yet,
someone else
will do it to us.

360
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,856
I am trying to be
more optimistic in life.

361
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:06,954
I've got, what,

362
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,452
20, 30 more years left,

363
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,555
and my family history says

364
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,430
I have less.

365
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,996
Now, the old Stanley Hudson
would have found

366
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,370
something to complain about
with this actress,

367
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,672
but that's no way
to live life.

368
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,945
Look at this healthy, sexy,

369
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,150
pretty, strong,
young woman.

370
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,219
Come on, people.

371
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,916
She is hot.

372
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,325
And it was
a terrible war.

373
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,092
Oh! So many died.

374
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,930
Far too many died,

375
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,665
but if Frodo hadrt
destroyed the ring,

376
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,670
then goodness itself
might have died.

377
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,469
You're right.
Yeah.

378
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,674
You are right.
I will call Wallace,

379
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,544
and I will give him
the customer list.

380
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,108
(EXHALES)

381
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,015
And I will give him
all of my info.

382
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,111
You are doing the
right thing, Michael.

383
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,349
Good. So...

384
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,816
Where are you going?

385
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,884
Just something
I have to do first.

386
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,361
Where are you taking
the client list?

387
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,365
Someplace safe,
where it can't
hurt anyone.

388
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,491
Michael!

389
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,428
Michael! No!

390
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,037
I will get it.

391
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,506
Michael, don't do this!

392
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,803
Don't do it!

393
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,167
Michael!

394
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,568
Michael!

395
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,072
Oh, shoot! My keys.
Come on, stop. Freeze.

396
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,981
Stop! Give me the list!

397
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,112
(DWIGHT GROWLING)

398
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,526
(PANTING)

399
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,898
No, no, no. No!

400
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,267
I can't let you do this.
Those people will be ruined!

401
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,306
It's business!
It's not personal!

402
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,869
(YELLING)

403
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,746
No!
Give it!

404
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,544
Dwight, give it!

405
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,777
You can't do this
to those people!

406
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,082
It's over, Michael.
It's over.

407
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,584
(BOTH PANTING)

408
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,993
I'm not a shark.

409
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,861
(YELLS)

410
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:33,927
No!

411
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,901
Okay, time for
the final vote.

412
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,801
All those in favor
of the resolution,
"Hilary Swank is hot."

413
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,004
Okay.

414
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,676
And all those opposed.

415
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,156
This is ridiculous.
That's the thing
about debating.

416
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,852
People just get
entrenched in the view
they had in the first place.

417
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,794
I could tell
when I was talking
you were not listening.

418
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,626
DAVID: This is great
stuff, Michael.

419
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,264
You are a titan
of industry, pal.

420
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,024
Yeah. Thank you.
Good work.

421
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,933
Look, I'll be in touch.
Thanks, buddy.

422
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,062
Okay. Bye-bye.

423
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,239
Well, guess whose stock
just went up, golden boy?

424
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,046
MICHAEL: I guess
this is what they call
a bittersweet moment.

425
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:28,486
It is bitter because
I slightly destroyed
a wonderful little family.

426
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,054
But sweet because
David Wallace thought
I did a good job.

427
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,428
That's why I hate
bittersweet chocolate.

428
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,003
I don't even...
What's the point of that?

429
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,666
Why not just sweet?
I mean, who are
you helping?

430
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,476
Oh, hey, what is this?

431
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,641
PAM: Hilary Swank.

432
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,945
Oh, she's hot.

433
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:57,982
Yeah!

434
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,948
Damn it.
