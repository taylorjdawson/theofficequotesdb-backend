1
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:06,333
Hey, so this isn't
matching up with this.

2
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:07,638
So I'm not sure which
one is right.

3
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:09,395
Can you just hand down
the original for me.

4
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:11,922
- Yes, me do.
- All right.

5
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:19,932
Hey, what were you saying before
about the paperwork?

6
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:22,662
Me doing now!
Go.

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,387
Stop worry.

8
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,105
Kevin, do you feel okay?

9
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:28,157
Me feel good.
Body strong.

10
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:29,992
Sleep big last night.

11
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:31,527
Yeah, I think we should
get him to the hospital.

12
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:33,029
Yeah, all right, Kevin.
Why don't you come with us?

13
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:34,780
- No, no, guys.
- No, he's fine.

14
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:36,983
- He's always been like that.
- No, he hasn't.

15
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,768
I mean, he's gotten worse
over the years, but...

16
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:41,153
He's making a statement.

17
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:43,439
It's an ironic comment
on our expectations of him.

18
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:46,942
A funhouse image
of our model of Kevin.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,610
You keep think that.

20
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,280
Me mechanic not speak English.

21
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:54,684
But he know what me mean
when me say, "car no go,"

22
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:56,285
and we best friends.

23
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:59,388
So me think,
why waste time say lot word

24
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:01,624
when few word do trick?

25
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:04,727
Kevin, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

26
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:06,829
Thank.

27
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:09,098
Here, we have a word code.

28
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:10,633
The same way
we have a dress code.

29
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:14,987
And what we're talking about
is basically

30
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:16,439
the speech equivalent

31
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:18,357
to just wearing underpants.

32
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:24,447
Sometimes,
words you no need use

33
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:27,333
but need-need
for talk-talk.

34
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:29,018
But save time.

35
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:30,002
More success.

36
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:31,320
Does it save time, though?

37
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:32,989
'Cause we've been here
for about an hour.

38
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:34,373
No me fault.

39
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:36,208
Kevin...

40
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,513
At most, you're saving
a microscopic amount of time.

41
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:43,382
Many small time make big time.

42
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:45,501
And what are you gonna do
with all this time?

43
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,019
See world.

44
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:48,838
Kevin, you can't possibly
save enough time

45
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:50,022
to see the world.

46
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:51,974
Kevin, are you saying,
"see the world"

47
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:53,609
or "seaworld"?

48
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:54,744
See world.

49
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:57,847
Oceans, fish, jump.

50
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:58,847
China.

51
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:00,616
No, see?
Right there,

52
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,151
that's the problem
with your method.

53
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:03,786
'Cause I still don't know
if you're saying seaworld

54
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,071
or see <i>the</i> world,

55
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:07,957
and it's taking a lot of time
to explain it.

56
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:09,325
Fine. Fine.

57
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,660
I'll talk normally.

58
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:13,829
When me president,

59
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:16,132
they see.

60
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,901
They see.

62
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:52,735
This week, we are rolling out

63
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:55,137
the brand-new
sabre tablet...

64
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,555
The pyramid.

65
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:58,507
Ooh, why is it
shaped like that?

66
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,675
So you can tell your clients,

67
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,044
"unleash the power
of the pyramid."

68
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:04,146
It's huge.
How much does it weigh?

69
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,547
Oh, no, no, no.
Without the battery pack

70
00:03:05,582 --> 00:03:06,649
and the optional
memory booster,

71
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:08,183
it's barely three pounds.

72
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:10,019
How much memory does it have
without the booster?

73
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:11,120
50 "l."

74
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:12,588
- I'm sorry, "L"?
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,023
How many "L" to a "K"?

76
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:15,424
You're really gonna
want the booster.

77
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,892
How on Earth
are we supposed to sell--

78
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:18,143
I'll take five.

79
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:20,529
Andy, don't make us
sell this stupid thing.

80
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:21,930
Oh, no, no, no, no.
This is Dwight's meeting.

81
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:23,666
- Thank you, the--
- I just wanted to pop in

82
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,485
and get your opinions
on ties and tie clips.

83
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,537
Which combo do you think
Robert's gonna like more?

84
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:32,074
What do you think, c-span?

85
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:33,108
C-span?

86
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,677
Yeah... C-span.

87
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:35,944
Cocker spaniel.

88
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,796
Spaniel 'cause of your
Spanish bloodline,

89
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,548
cocker 'cause...

90
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:43,986
Is this really the best use
of our collective time?

91
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,955
I am still forming a first
impression with Robert.

92
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,725
Once it is formed,
we can all relax, okay?

93
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,994
I'm sorry to hijack
your meeting, d-dub-dog.

94
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:53,795
Had to pull rank.

95
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:59,134
Okay.
Let's look at some ties.

96
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:01,236
Here's how I'm gonna
help out from now on.

97
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,938
I'm going to not care.

98
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:04,840
And I'm gonna
sit around quietly

99
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:07,476
waiting for Andy's
inevitable demise.

100
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,528
Your friend Neil Patrick Harris

101
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,613
really made me laugh
the other night.

102
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,482
Um, D-dog,
you have a message.

103
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,017
Erin, you don't need
to call him that.

104
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:17,152
Andy wants us to, P-dog.

105
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:19,221
It's okay, E-dog.
Just who called?

106
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:20,923
Justine. She said
she's coming by later.

107
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:22,391
Your ex-wife?

108
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:23,709
Wait, I thought
she was a [Bleep]

109
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,427
And you [Bleep] hated her guts.

110
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:26,828
- Kevin...
- Oh, my God.

111
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:28,881
No, no, no, no.
I like her.

112
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:30,833
Well, I'm just quoting you.

113
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,167
I would never
say that about her.

114
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:33,185
I don't know the woman.

115
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,521
No, man.
We get along now.

116
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:36,555
Real well.

117
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:37,606
Wow. All right.

118
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,607
Can't wait to meet her.

119
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:40,342
I'll introduce you.

120
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,578
Yeah, we had a few fights,
I suppose.

121
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:45,247
But last night, we put
a lot of that to bed.

122
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:49,952
I can't tell you what I did
with my ex-wife last night.

123
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:51,353
I have to sing it.

Hi, dad.

129
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,142
Ah--ohh.
Oh, boy.

130
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,594
Hello, Andy.
Excellent tie.

131
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,596
Would you be requiring
a cold beverage

132
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:18,597
while you're here?

133
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:20,566
I'd love some coffee.

134
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,402
I was looking over
your projections,

135
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:25,053
and I think we can to better.

136
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:26,905
Are you factoring in

137
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,058
the whole national economy...
Declining and all that?

138
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:32,377
Andy, do you know why
I chose you?

139
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,696
I think I can sum up
with what I think

140
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:37,599
is your favorite
ice cream flavor.

141
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:38,700
Vanilla.

142
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:41,203
Valla? No, no.

143
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:42,805
You'll never guess
in a million,

144
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,273
billion years,
you'll never guess.

145
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:46,642
You were saying you chose me.

146
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:49,544
There was a reason.

147
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:52,147
Andy, can you inspire?

148
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:55,550
Do you have that skill set?

149
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:56,685
Can I inspire?

150
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:59,221
I don't know!

151
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:02,157
I don't know.

152
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:04,526
Oh, thank you.

153
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:05,561
- Oh, uh--
- Oh, sorry.

154
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:06,895
Here, just put it down.

155
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,996
Oh.

156
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:19,258
Mm.

157
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:22,344
Ah. That is very cold.

158
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:25,180
Yeah, it's old.

159
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:26,648
Why would I--

160
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:27,883
I asked if you wanted
a cold beverage,

161
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,618
and you said coffee.

162
00:06:29,652 --> 00:06:31,987
Why don't we get Robert
a nice, hot, fresh cup,

163
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:32,971
and I will have this.

164
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:34,306
Andy, you don't want that.

165
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:36,925
I've been craving a freezing
cup of old coffee.

166
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,644
Mmm.

167
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:39,645
Sorry.

168
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:43,198
You like her.

169
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:46,435
I-I do.

170
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:48,436
Yeah.
She likes you.

171
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:50,455
You know, we've both
been into each other

172
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,473
at different times,

173
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:53,408
and just never really
synced up.

174
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:54,660
Now we're in
this weird dance--

175
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:57,112
I'm afraid you've
lost my interest.

176
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:00,999
Let me call you back.

177
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,551
I gotta go.

178
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:08,507
If the office superstore

179
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:11,126
was supposed to put us little
suppliers out of business,

180
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:12,861
why are we still here?

181
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:16,014
Yeah.

182
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:17,566
This is where we go.

183
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,167
You'd go someplace else.

184
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:20,569
That's not it.
That's not the answer.

185
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:22,638
- It's a answer.
- It's a wrong answer.

186
00:07:22,672 --> 00:07:25,874
- There are no wrong answers.
- Take a look at where you are.

187
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:29,745
Where you once worked
in a dying industry,

188
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,847
you now work at its birth.

189
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:37,419
The superstores
are terrified of us.

190
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:39,821
Anybody know why?

191
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:42,324
Wait...They're terrified?

192
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:44,760
Let me tell you how I buy
something these days.

193
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,545
I know what I want,
I go on the Internet

194
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:47,763
and get the best price.

195
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:49,715
Or I don't know what I want,

196
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:52,134
and I go to a small store

197
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:53,669
that can help me.

198
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:55,604
The era of personal service
is back.

199
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,906
You are back.

200
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:01,843
You'll find that customers
will pay our higher prices

201
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:03,545
and then they will thank us,

202
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,815
and we will say to them,
"you are welcome."

203
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:12,571
Ah, thank you.

204
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,373
Ooh!

205
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,242
Andrew, I chose you
for a reason.

206
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:19,461
Lead these people.

207
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:22,414
Show me the best numbers
this place has ever seen.

208
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:24,800
Last quarter we saw 4% growth.

209
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,218
Double it.
You got it.

210
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:27,469
- Double.
- Done.

211
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:29,554
- I'm not kidding.
- Neither am I.

212
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,940
It's already done.
Ha. I'm just kidding.

213
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,009
- It's gonna take some time.
- Double.

214
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:42,418
Hey.

215
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:52,861
Hey...

216
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:56,832
What's up, guys?

217
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:59,134
Just thought we'd have
a little rap session,

218
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:02,237
talk about business,
see how things are going.

219
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:07,242
Well, you start.

220
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:08,577
If no one else wants to.

221
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,412
I was just thinking about
Robert.

222
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:14,950
Man, what a boss.
Just...Throws down goals,

223
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:16,285
you know?

224
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:19,054
Anyway, how's the sales doubling
project going?

225
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,456
How are we supposed to do that?

226
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,224
We can't just press
a magic button.

227
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:24,126
Of course not.
There's no magic button.

228
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,462
You have to...

229
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:28,029
Summon that.

230
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:29,415
If we could just
double our sales,

231
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:30,699
we already would have.

232
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:32,033
You're not making sense.

233
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:33,752
He brings up two good points.

234
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:35,204
Do you have any new leads,

235
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:37,106
any new territories
you want us to look into,

236
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,774
maybe have an in
with a big client

237
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:40,542
that we could get
our foot in the door?

238
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:43,445
Dwight, anything?

239
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,981
We could talk about
how fast children grow up.

240
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:48,267
And before you know it,
they're out of the house.

241
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:50,285
You know what?
We need to get our heads

242
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,453
out of the box.

243
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:53,555
If we did have something,

244
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:55,157
what would it look like?

245
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:56,658
What would it be?

246
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:57,943
Tuna.

247
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:00,229
New leads,
a new territory to look into,

248
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:02,448
maybe an in with a big company

249
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,399
that we could get
our foot in the door.

250
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:07,469
Fart.

251
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,606
Good sesh.

252
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,576
That leg's asleep.

253
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,314
Hello.

254
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:20,983
I'm looking for
a Darryl Philbin.

255
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:23,018
Don't-- Oh...

256
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:24,686
You must think--
I'm not.

257
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:27,589
I'm using the fax.
This isn't-- No, wait.

258
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:29,658
I'm not supposed
to represent the company, right?

259
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:31,643
There's usually an Erin here.

260
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:32,694
- Okay.
- So...

261
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:35,948
Darryl!
A girl!

262
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,317
♪ Rub a dub dub ♪

263
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:40,452
♪ with the apricot scrub ♪

264
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:41,804
What's up, darling?

265
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:44,106
Hey, everybody,
this is justine.

266
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,774
- Hello.
- Hi, justine.

267
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:48,644
- Hi.
- This is Jim

268
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:50,779
and Oscar.
Hi.

269
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:52,614
Everybody.
Hello.

270
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:55,968
Kevin.

271
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,721
Can we go someplace private?

272
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:02,508
Follow me.
I got a space.

273
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,625
After you.

274
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,961
I been thinking about you
all morning.

275
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:08,931
I don't know what you did.
I can barely walk today.

276
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,804
D-bone.
There you are.

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,023
Let me guess.
Somebody needs a brownie!

278
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:20,375
Lick the spoon?
No, that's okay.

279
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,661
I just-- I wanted to ask you

280
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,847
about...
Is this about the profits?

281
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:27,249
Because if it is,
I just don't see the point.

282
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:28,517
It's so wall street.

283
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:31,003
- I know, right?
- Right?

284
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,754
- Yeah.
- Ha.

285
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,423
Um...

286
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:36,592
How is everything?

287
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:38,527
Good.
Really, really good.

288
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:40,262
Must be a tough time
to be a family farm.

289
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:41,763
Oh, it is.

290
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:43,932
And beets are not immune.

291
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,467
We made some inroads in salad,

292
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:48,020
but heirloom tomatoes
are pushing back.

293
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:49,838
Oof. What are you
gonna do about that?

294
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:52,173
I don't know.
What do you mean?

295
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,610
Gotta be some way you could
double your beet sales.

296
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,061
You wanted the job.
The job is yours.

297
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:59,180
Just do the job.

298
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:02,851
And I'll...Do mine.

299
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:05,353
Walnuts?

300
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,539
No!

301
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:13,462
Have you seen this?

302
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:14,596
<i>Parenting?</i> Yeah.

303
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:16,197
This is Cece's
favorite magazine.

304
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:17,916
She loves the pictures
of babies.

305
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,501
She looks at it
when she's on the potty,

306
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:21,203
and she makes the faces--
- Have you read it?

307
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:23,639
Has an adult member
of your family

308
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:26,108
read this particular issue?

309
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:27,542
I flipped through it.

310
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:29,878
So you saw the article
on the importance

311
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,813
of taking frequent walks
while you're pregnant.

312
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:34,216
- Of course, yeah.
- Everyone knows that.

313
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,351
I will be taking a morning
walk and an afternoon walk.

314
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:39,271
Would you like to join me?
That sounds nice.

315
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:40,689
Great.

316
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,325
You have a walking buddy.

317
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:45,560
I do!

318
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,729
- Thanks for coming in, guys.
- You don't have to thank us

319
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,731
for coming in-- It's our job.

320
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:52,067
Well, I never got thanked
for coming into a meeting,

321
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,636
and I always wanted to be,
so I'm gonna thank people.

322
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:55,904
What's under the blanket?

323
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:59,758
This is what's under
the blanket.

324
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,677
We...Don't get it.

325
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,295
These are incentives.

326
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:05,580
It's how we're gonna
double growth.

327
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:07,749
Now, you're probably all
asking yourselves,

328
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:09,851
"well, how does this work?"

329
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:11,186
Seems like a basic
reward system

330
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,638
where you give us points

331
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:15,357
and then we redeem those points
for prizes.

332
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,476
You're exactly right,
and you get a point.

333
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:19,945
- Oh!
- Is that a vibrator?

334
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:22,931
- 20 points.
- How does one get a point?

335
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,833
I've outlined the exact
parameters in an email,

336
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:26,068
so check your spam folders.

337
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:27,502
But basically...

338
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:29,204
You do your job better,
you get points.

339
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:31,606
So... Collect 15 points,

340
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:34,209
and redeem them for
this polar bear.

341
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:35,877
Why is it all kids' stuff
and a vibrator?

342
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:37,012
It's so gross.

343
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,647
There's lots of stuff.

344
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,817
John Irving, collected works.
22 points.

345
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:45,286
Or you can pool your points
and redeem 55

346
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:47,122
for this maternity shirt.

347
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,007
How about you want us

348
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:51,292
to work harder, pay us more?
I can't.

349
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,961
This point system
is really insulting.

350
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:55,347
Ooh. Well, I didn't
mean to offend you,

351
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:57,399
and I hope you'll forgive me,

352
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,634
because I'm very, very...
Sari.

353
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:02,154
16 points.
It's a tablecloth.

354
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:03,972
What if went all the way up
to 500 points?

355
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:05,490
That's a crazy
amount of points.

356
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,376
- But what if?
- Well, what do you want?

357
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,528
I don't know.
For such a crazy number,

358
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:11,313
I'd like something
pretty crazy.

359
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:13,081
All right.
For 500 points,

360
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:14,683
I will wear a dress to work.

361
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,151
Ah!

362
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,318
That's pretty good.

363
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:20,088
What about, uh, for
1,000 points?

364
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:21,656
I'll run naked
through the parking lot

365
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:23,542
with a doughnut on my dingdong.

366
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:26,178
Yeah? You like that?

367
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,897
All right, for 5,000 points,

368
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:31,633
I will...Let you
tattoo whatever you want

369
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,202
on the stern
of the old <i>SS Bernard.</i>

370
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:35,554
- Oh!
- Here we go!

371
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:37,773
All right, all right,
and you are totally serious.

372
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:40,392
Swear to God, hope to die.
Now, let's get to work!

373
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:43,945
Wait. But you did say
we could pool our points, right?

374
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,897
In that case,
let's get to work.

375
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:47,949
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

376
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:50,235
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

377
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,228
All right, thank you very much.

378
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:58,430
Uh, Phyllis, brachen auto?

379
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,499
Ask for Donald.
Karen's bananas.

380
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,001
I just want you to benefit
from our...

381
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,203
T-bag-bone.

382
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:05,287
Andrew.

383
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,041
Have you noticed just
a little bit

384
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,276
of a mood shift around here?

385
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,944
No, I haven't noticed anything.

386
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,095
Really?

387
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,181
Because I sat next to Stanley
for years,

388
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,850
and this is naptime.

389
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,951
- Yeah?
- Open-eye naptime.

390
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,219
He balances the phone
on his shoulder

391
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,220
and just powers down.

392
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,254
Now look at him.

393
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,440
You've got to unleash the power

394
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,691
of the pyramid.

395
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,694
I don't know
what to tell you, man.

396
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,029
You think it
has something to do

397
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,330
with that incentive program?

398
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,364
Oh, 100%.

399
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,449
We all want to see you
tattoo your ass.

400
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,867
Uh...

401
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,235
I think people thought
I was kidding

402
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,303
when I said that.

403
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,604
No, you definitely
weren't kidding.

404
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:40,439
That came across
loud and clear.

405
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:42,041
Oh, by the way,
wanna hand this in?

406
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,309
120 points?

407
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,343
Yeah, big sale.

408
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,494
Don't worry about it, though.

409
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,662
I don't really care
about the points.

410
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,881
I would like
a point receipt, though.

411
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,550
Hey, yes, this is Jim Halpert
calling for Donald.

412
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:53,052
Can you hold on for one second?

413
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,503
Thank you very much.

414
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,005
Who talked to Maggie
at Kaufman's?

415
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,956
Erin.

416
00:15:57,974 --> 00:15:59,558
Yes, Mrs. Guffner?

417
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,510
Right.

418
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,895
And I'm back.

419
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,813
How are you, sir?

420
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:08,234
Erin can squeeze a couple more
golf games in, right?

421
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,440
No, I'm not getting out there
anytime soon.

422
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,158
Hey, Kevin.
What are you doing?

423
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:19,811
Don't talk to me!

424
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,703
Hi, Professor Frank.

425
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,355
Andy Bernard, class of '95.

426
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,539
Hey, there.

427
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,225
Um, I'm a huge fan
of your management book,

428
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,593
<i>management.</i>

429
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,095
Um, quick question.

430
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,097
I may be missing
a chapter here.

431
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,999
De-incentivizing?

432
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,100
What are your strategies?

433
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,202
Looking for a real blow
to morale.

434
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,471
Uh, why?

435
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,873
Well, um, I guess you could say

436
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:50,943
I'm in one of those classic
ass-tattoo incentive situations.

437
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,449
Yes!

438
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,573
Took 'em one day.

439
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,874
Are you ready?

440
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,910
"I'm not as think
as you drunk I am."

441
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,029
I like it.

442
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:12,030
I like it.

443
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,198
"Do not resuscitate."

444
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,302
Okay, let's keep in mind,

445
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,203
it's not too late
to choose another prize.

446
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:20,923
And there are
some great new additions.

447
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,841
My car--

448
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,543
For 1,000 points.

449
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,577
Or best offer.

450
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:26,762
What else you got?

451
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,314
Oh, and then this
was Phyllis's idea.

452
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,903
- Oh, my God!
- So nasty, Phyllis.

453
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:41,827
We were hoping you could do
something like this.

454
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,895
So coming out
of his butt is a--

455
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:44,896
- Baby.
- Baby.

456
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,398
Yes.

457
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,733
Yeah, no problem.

458
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,569
You should think about this.

459
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:52,671
Anyone have any better ideas?

460
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,089
I like what we have.

461
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:55,207
- Yeah, nice try.
- Yeah.

462
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,308
For sure what we have.

463
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,426
- It's funny.
- It's apropos.

464
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,098
Just need a second outside.

465
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,191
- You getting psyched up?
- Yeah.

466
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,476
Andy, nobody really expects
you to go through with this.

467
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,661
Tunes...

468
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,930
What am I doing here?

469
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:21,099
Why did Robert pick me?

470
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:24,269
Confession,
I don't know what I'm doing.

471
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,538
I mean, do you like it?

472
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:27,656
You having fun?

473
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,409
Tell you this,

474
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,311
everybody else is having
a lot of fun.

475
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,630
And you did that.

476
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:36,415
But my ass is only so big.

477
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,850
I mean, I can't do this
every day.

478
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,351
But I think it's big enough
to buy you some time

479
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,170
till your next great idea.

480
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,056
Which, by the way,
I can't wait for.

481
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,294
No one expects me to go
through with this, right?

482
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,896
Absolutely not.

483
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,986
Let's ink my stink!

484
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,823
- Andy!
- Yeah!

485
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:02,825
My heart belongs to music.

486
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:06,378
But my ass belongs
to these people.

487
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:07,913
Whoa!

488
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,649
Good stuff.

489
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:14,420
Do your worst.

490
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,672
Uh, you can keep
your pants on, actually.

491
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:17,823
If you just drop 'em
down a bit,

492
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:18,990
that'd be great.

493
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:20,259
They're already off,
my good sir.

494
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,494
I'd really prefer
they not be down.

495
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:23,662
Well, I think down's better.

496
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,097
Sweating pretty heavily
down there.

497
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:32,721
Do you think you could work
from this?

498
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,339
We made some small adjustments.

499
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:36,041
- Okay, you want me to--
- Just these few adjustments.

500
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:37,726
Yeah.

501
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,611
All right, let's begin.

502
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,230
This is where I grin and--
Ow! Ow!

503
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,347
That was just a cotton swab.

504
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:45,200
Invest in softer cotton, sir.

505
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:47,853
Whew.

506
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:49,354
Oh, boy.

507
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,206
<i>Oww!</i>

508
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,458
Ohhh! Ho, ho!

509
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:55,878
Ohhh!

510
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,296
Whoa!

511
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,765
Obviously, you can go
the ass tattoo route.

512
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,301
And obviously,
I'm gonna like it.

513
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,436
Draw some blood!
Ha!

514
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,590
Ahhhhh-haaaaa!

515
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,345
Great tattoo.

516
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,881
Why did I choose Andy
to run the office?

517
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:19,218
Because he's all surface,
uncomplicated.

518
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,153
What you see is what you get.

519
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,989
Could be a recipe
for mediocrity, yes,

520
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,724
but then again,
it might just be

521
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:29,444
why people fight for him.

522
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,396
It's a nard dog.

523
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,117
That's my nickety-name.

524
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,169
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo!

525
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,587
I love it.
I love it.

526
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:39,788
Pull up your pants.

527
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,457
There's something
about an underdog

528
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:47,212
that really inspires
the unexceptional.

529
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,715
Um, what should we talk about?

530
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:53,101
Well, we could talk
about an ethical dilemma

531
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,386
I'm having.

532
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:55,553
Oh, yeah, sure.

533
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,322
Um, I hope I can help.

534
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,192
A coworker of mine is drinking
caffeine while pregnant,

535
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,593
and I don't know if I should
call social services

536
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:02,778
about it.

537
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,030
Angela, that's pretty
