181
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,798
Will you be heard?

182
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,834
Will you have a voice?

183
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,136
Will I steamroll over you?

184
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:23,374
Do you feel heard
right now, Jim?

185
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:27,011
Do you have a voice right now?

186
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,147
You can answer me.
Yes.

187
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,182
That was your choice, not mine.

188
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,719
The fallacy is that it is
up to the steamroller.

189
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,388
It is up to the object...

190
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,691
Whether it will be
flattened or not.

191
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:42,160
And I can tell just from
the small interaction

192
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,394
we've had already,

193
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,163
you won't be flattened
by anybody.

194
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,431
Do you agree with me, Jim?

195
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:49,367
- Yes.
- Yes, you do.

196
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,890
He creeps me out.

197
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:14,726
But I think
he might be a genius.

198
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:23,992
Good luck, Darryl.

199
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:25,927
Thank you.

200
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:27,061
Think about it.

201
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,863
What other mammal,
besides humans,

202
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:31,132
drinks the milk
of another mammal?

203
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,668
I mean, you don't see a bear
drinking raccoon milk.

204
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,503
[Laughter]

205
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:38,539
So this is cool.
I think we make a good fit.

206
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:41,342
Oh. Uh, we haven't
started the interview yet.

207
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,511
Were you--
Were you joking?

208
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:45,313
[Laughs]

209
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:48,316
Uh...Yes.
I was.

210
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:51,519
Little joke.

211
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:54,689
So how would you go about
settling interpersonal conflicts

212
00:08:54,757 --> 00:08:56,157
within the office?

213
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:58,693
I thought that was your job.

214
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,995
Well, it's one of my strengths,

215
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,664
but it's the manager's job.

216
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,434
Well, for instance,
how did you deal with it

217
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:07,835
when two warehouse guys
got into a fight?

218
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:09,304
I'll answer that, Jim.

219
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:12,707
I would use it
as an opportunity to teach...

220
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:16,577
Uh, about actions
and consequences

221
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:18,780
of actions.

222
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,689
Who's that?

223
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:29,624
So I think all we need
is a resume,

224
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,726
and we'll be good, right?

225
00:09:31,794 --> 00:09:34,062
I-I just thought
you knew me.

226
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,196
Yeah, it's no big deal.

227
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:37,632
Just something
that looks like that.

228
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,833
Cool.

229
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:40,835
Let me...

230
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:42,670
Oh.

231
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:44,505
Cool.

232
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:53,981
Did, uh, you just interview?

233
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,750
Oh. Unfortunately, yes.

234
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:00,722
W-what do you mean?

235
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:03,191
That business
can't attract anyone.

236
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:05,526
It's awful up there.

237
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:08,629
Those people seem like
they're in prison

238
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:09,997
waiting out life sentences

239
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:12,834
in a...
Dying industry.

240
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:15,670
Place must be horrible.

241
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,775
I don't know
if I want this job.

242
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:22,009
Well, if I get this job offer,

243
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:23,745
then I know
that I'm gonna take it.

244
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:26,347
And if I take it, I know
that I'm never gonna quit.

245
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:32,587
And then 25 years
are gonna go by, and...

246
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:34,555
I'm gonna die here.

247
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,424
What makes you feel qualified
to judge a place

248
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:38,459
after a mere interview?

249
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:49,437
What are you doing?

250
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,741
Stop trying to figure me out.

251
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:55,476
- I just did.
- You can't.

252
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,445
- It's done.
- No, it's not.

253
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:58,980
I know you now.
I know your nature.

254
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:01,215
You don't know me-- You don't
know anything about me.

255
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:02,550
- I'm done.
- Get out of my head.

256
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,619
- Not worth continuing.
- Stop trying to figure me out.

257
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:06,587
[Clears throat]

258
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:10,625
Do you even know
anything about paper?

259
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,093
How it's made?

260
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:13,995
I saw an episode
on how they make paper

261
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:15,630
<i>on sesame street.</i>

262
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,734
Get out.

263
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:20,968
I'm gonna prevent inferior men

264
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:22,470
from sullying my place of work

265
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:24,806
with their weak,
passionless leadership.

266
00:11:24,873 --> 00:11:27,408
Do you see my hat?
No?

267
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:30,144
That's because I just
threw it in the ring.

268
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:32,814
You guys pay for relocation,
though, right?

269
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:34,816
Well, why would you need
relocation

270
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:36,117
if you already live
in Scranton?

271
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:38,753
Well, I'd wanna move
further away, you know?

272
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:40,087
Just...Don't want any chance

273
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:42,423
of running into my coworkers
outside the office.

274
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,994
Can I ask why
you're leaving your current job?

275
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:52,033
I'm leaving my other job

276
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,368
because they were all...
Jerks.

277
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:56,204
Really.
You know, all of them.

278
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:58,840
You had your jerk wads
and your jerk offs, so...

279
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:01,142
Just between the wads
and the offs,

280
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,877
I just--
I had to get outta there.

281
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:04,812
Is this a bad time
to be doing this?

282
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,782
I'm having a bad time.
[Laughs]

283
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,217
I'm sorry.

284
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,652
I-if we did something
to upset you,

285
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,488
I-I'm sure it was
inadvertent.

286
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,162
Wait.

287
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,799
Oh, why did I believe
that weirdo in the lobby?

288
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:27,735
These are the nicest people
I ever met.

289
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:30,805
Thank you.

290
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:34,308
It's gorgeous, Angela.

291
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:35,910
Yeah, I actually know
about nice rings,

292
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:37,478
and it is gorgeous.
Oh...Wow.

293
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:39,480
It's a little flashy.
I mean, what am I...

294
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:41,215
Naomi judd?

295
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:44,151
- Tell us the freaking story!
- Yeah, tell us the story.

296
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:46,420
Okay.
He took me to the replica

297
00:12:46,488 --> 00:12:48,289
of Monet's Japanese bridge.

298
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:50,224
And then he put this flower
behind my ear,

299
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:51,692
which normally I would hate,

300
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,094
'cause it's so civil rightsy.

301
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:55,730
Then he got down
on one knee and he said,

302
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:58,566
"will you be
a senator's wife?"

303
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:01,769
Oh! He talked about himself
in the third person?

304
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:03,170
Yes, Pam.

305
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:05,907
Not everyone is as informal
as you and Jim.

306
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:08,175
[Imitating jim]
"Oh, hey, Pam, dude, whatever.

307
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:09,377
Wanna marry me?"

308
00:13:09,444 --> 00:13:12,046
[Laughter] That's not accurate.

309
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:14,415
Then I saw flashes.
Reporters were there.

310
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:17,952
They always find us.
And everyone was crying.

311
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,187
Even his aide.

312
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,924
Angela's engaged to a gay man.

313
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:25,426
As a gay man, I'm horrified.

314
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:28,062
As a friend of Angela's,
horrified.

315
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,730
As a lover of elegant weddings,

316
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:31,933
I'm a little excited.

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,069
But overall, horrified.

318
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:36,237
Andy?

319
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:38,739
You all set?

320
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:41,542
Okay, guys.
It's time.

321
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,946
It's pep talk time.
Tell me what I need to hear.

322
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:47,214
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

323
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:49,383
I hate to see you disappointed.

324
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,551
[Grunts]

325
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:52,119
I think Andy
should be the boss.

326
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:53,955
He's just so great.

327
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:57,325
If I'm being objective,
then Darryl, of course.

328
00:13:57,392 --> 00:13:59,026
So Andy,
what improvements would you make

329
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:00,995
as office manager?
For starters, I really think

330
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:02,830
we can streamline communication
around here.

331
00:14:02,898 --> 00:14:04,465
Whoa. That's
a very heavy accusation

332
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:07,234
to level against Toby.

333
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:09,737
- I wasn't a-accusing--
- Well, Toby's in charge

334
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:10,805
of human resources.

335
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:12,406
That would include
communication.

336
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:14,275
I think that Toby's
done a fine job.

337
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:18,179
Right. I-I-I really wasn't
trying to insult a-anyone.

338
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:20,481
I didn't think you were.

339
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,249
I have two relationships
with Andy.

340
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:23,884
I have a personal relationship,

341
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:25,853
and I have a professional
relationship.

342
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:27,788
Personally, yeah,
I think he's a rat

343
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:29,123
and I think he's responsible

344
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:31,592
for the demise of my
relationship with Erin.

345
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,195
Professionally...

346
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:36,197
He broke up the happiest
couple in this office.

347
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:37,898
How many windows are there
in New York City?

348
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:39,867
- What?
- Critical thinking.

349
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:42,403
Common on-the-spot question
asked in an interview.

350
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:45,306
Okay. Uh...Let me think.
Are you counting car windows?

351
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:47,408
No. How far away
is the sun?

352
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,844
Uh, 93 million Miles.

353
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:52,813
- Is it?
- Yeah.

354
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:55,049
And the diameter of the sun
is 870,000 miles,

355
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:57,385
which makes it 109 times
wider than the earth

356
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:00,321
and 333,000 times
heavier than the earth.

357
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:01,856
Shut up about the sun.

358
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:04,892
<i>Shut up about the sun!</i>

359
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:11,732
I am unhappy with the confusing

360
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,403
and, at times, confrontational
nature of that meeting.

361
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,304
I wanted it to go better.

362
00:15:17,372 --> 00:15:19,707
<i>I wanted it to go better!</i>

363
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,677
Yes, there used to be
a paper clip

364
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:24,011
that would pop up and say,

365
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,480
"looks like you are writing
a letter or resume.

366
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,449
Would you like help?"

367
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:31,052
I believe his name was...
Clippy.

368
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:34,488
First of all, I wanna thank you

369
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:36,891
for your years
of patronizing our company.

370
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,660
I've got some bad news.

371
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,062
We're going out of business.

372
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:43,230
[Whispers] Saving face.

373
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:44,398
Yep, yep.

374
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:46,567
I understand that.

375
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:48,569
Basically everything's
falling apart here.

376
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:51,038
How is this on me?

377
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:53,374
Hang up.

378
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:55,443
Corporate needs you
to find the differences

379
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,213
between this picture
and this picture.

380
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:01,549
Intel has told us
there are at least seven.

381
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,517
Okay. I already see one.
Gimme.

382
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:04,819
Okay.

383
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:08,889
They're the same picture.

384
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,624
Well, I manage my department,

385
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:13,060
and I've been doing that
for several years now.

386
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:16,363
And, God, I've learned a lot
of life lessons along the way.

387
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,399
Your department's
just you, right?

388
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:21,001
Yes, Jim, but I am not
easy to manage.

389
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:24,171
Great.
Um, can we just...

390
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:26,073
- What was that?
- We just have

391
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:29,944
a lot of serious candidates
to get through today, so...

392
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:32,046
Am I not a serious candidate?

393
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:34,782
What do you want me to say?

394
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,084
I mean, there's a line
of qualified people out there.

395
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:39,086
We have a video CV
from England.

396
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:40,721
Are we all just gonna
pretend to--

397
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:43,257
okay. Um...

398
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:45,025
What are your weaknesses?

399
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:46,861
I don't have any, asshole.

400
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:51,766
I want an interview.

401
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:54,568
How's the family?
Good.

402
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:57,238
- Good? Are they good?
- Yeah.

403
00:16:57,305 --> 00:16:58,873
What's your daughter's
name again?

404
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,974
Peepee?

405
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,942
- Peepa.
- Peepa. How is she?

406
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,878
- Great.
- Great!

407
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:06,213
Oh, that's great.

408
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,482
We never were very good
at smalltalk, were we, Jim?

409
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,717
- No.
- Now, listen--

410
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:12,052
You're not getting
an interview, Dwight.

411
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,321
The whole point
of this search committee process

412
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:16,490
is to prevent hiring
someone like you ever again.

413
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:17,792
Okay. I know why
you're saying that, Jim.

414
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:20,060
I really do.
But think of it this way.

415
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:22,062
The hand that reaches
from the grave

416
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,731
to grip your throat

417
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,566
is the strong hand
you want on the wheel.

418
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:27,568
- Okay. That's vivid.
- Now, I'm gonna make you

419
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:28,969
an offer, okay?

420
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:32,306
You even do so little
as grant me an interview,

421
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:34,909
I will guarantee you
your dream work life, okay?

422
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:37,444
You roll in at 10:00 AM

423
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:39,847
to your own private
reserved parking spot,

424
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:42,783
pick up your daily free coffee
from Dwight's caffeine corner,

425
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:45,419
unlimited sex breaks
for you and Pam.

426
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:46,821
- Yikes.
- Erin will eat garbage

427
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:48,255
for your entertainment.

428
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:50,491
Wow. You know how I like
taking bribes.

429
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,026
- Ha ha!
- But unfortunately,

430
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:53,594
jo also took the job
away from you

431
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:55,362
because she doesn't
trust your judgment.

432
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,964
So how would that look for me

433
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,866
if I recommended you?

434
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,167
Fine.

435
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:03,270
I'll do it without you.
You'll regret this.

436
00:18:03,338 --> 00:18:04,371
Okay.

437
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,541
Let me get that for you.

438
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,543
- Thank you.
- Okay.

439
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:17,322
Pam, I think Robert is gay.

440
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,924
The senator?

441
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:22,227
He was married before,
and he has a kid.

442
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:23,461
- So--
- And don't say that thing

443
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:26,498
about how lots of gay guys
have kids.

444
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,434
I have a very strong suspicion.

445
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:31,269
Did you see him at a bathhouse?

446
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:32,937
What bathhouse?

447
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,140
The windowless building
by the Baskin Robbins.

448
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,075
What?

449
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:39,277
Forget it. I'm never
gonna know what goes on there.

450
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:40,945
My friend at the Scranton blade

451
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:42,414
is totally plugged into
these matters.

452
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:44,282
You're in the gay mafia.

453
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,784
You're thinking of
another group--

454
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:48,787
Much wealthier, much older.
[Whispers] You sound ignorant.

455
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:52,023
You guys, um...
Talking senator?

456
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:54,259
- No.
- No.

457
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:55,960
Why would we be talking
about the senator?

458
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:57,729
'Cause he's totally gay.

459
00:18:57,797 --> 00:18:58,830
Um...

460
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:00,632
How do I know
that Robert is gay?

461
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,401
He "liked" my Facebook photos

462
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:05,370
at 3:00 in the morning.

463
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:08,340
Name-- David Brent.
Occupation-- Inspirer.

464
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:10,675
Status-- None of your business.

465
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:12,010
Young, free,
and single, though.

466
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:13,311
Thanks for asking.

467
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,480
Hey, you're looking
for a new boss, yeah?

468
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:17,649
Someone to tell
a bunch of discontented,

469
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,951
under-encouraged drones
what to do every day.

470
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:22,787
Is that it? Oh.
Our out-of-touch powers that be.

471
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:25,590
Want me to fire them?
They don't see things your way?

472
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:27,625
Then I am that dude.
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.

473
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:29,561
Get some other corporate suit
to lay down the law.

474
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,363
What?
You've changed your mind?

475
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,398
You're now looking for
a leader of men?

476
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:36,034
Ipso facto...Women too.

477
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:37,836
When do I start?

478
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,471
Huh?

479
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:42,574
Do you know what it took
to get Bob to notice me?

480
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,476
I waited in his office
every morning

481
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,511
wearing nothing but
kitty cat ears.

482
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,646
I did that every day
for two weeks.

483
00:19:48,714 --> 00:19:50,014
And on the tenth day,
he walked in.

484
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:52,317
He was naked too,
except a dog nose.

485
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:55,186
- Guess what we did then?
- I don't think I can do that--

486
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:56,721
- Bestiality.
- Yeah.

487
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,423
That's not my personality.

488
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:01,559
If my daughter
were asking me...

489
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:02,594
Yes?

490
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:03,928
[Both giggling]

491
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,764
I would say
if you want someone--

492
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:09,167
If you really want them--

493
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:11,503
Go get them.

494
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,507
I do really want him.

495
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:17,876
So, uh...
Here you go.

496
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,911
- Great.
- Hope it's all right.

497
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:22,080
I'm sure it's fine.

498
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:23,415
The guy who was
in here earlier,

499
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:25,350
interviewed after me...
How'd he do?

500
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:26,684
Howard cline?

501
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:28,386
That's not
who I'm talking about.

502
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:31,189
Oh. Deshaun Williams.

503
00:20:31,257 --> 00:20:32,724
Yes. How did he do?

504
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:35,293
He's an amazing man.
He's a rhodes scholar.

505
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:37,862
He invented an app
that invents apps.

506
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,897
Fantastic kisser.

507
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:40,965
Common, man.
I'm being serious.

508
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,268
It's no joke.
Darryl, we all know you.

509
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:46,604
Your interview is not nearly
as important as the other guy's.

510
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:48,006
[Knocks on desk]

511
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:49,574
[British accent]
First I'll take down

512
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:51,943
- the cubicle walls.
- But there aren't--

513
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:53,411
Symbol of transparency.

514
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,780
There'd be no titles.

515
00:20:55,848 --> 00:20:58,116
Everyone has the same job.

516
00:20:58,184 --> 00:20:59,918
Same goes for me.

517
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:03,421
I'd take your job,
but I'd reject the title.

518
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:04,556
A little unspecific.

519
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:06,424
Everyone would be known

520
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,426
for their accomplishments.

521
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:10,428
That's very interesting.

522
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:12,530
Um...I feel like
there might be a conflict there,

523
00:21:12,598 --> 00:21:15,633
and if a conflict did arise,
how would that be dealt with?

524
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:18,803
Oh!
Yeah.

525
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:19,838
Mm.

526
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,272
Scratch everything from before.

527
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,308
I tell you what I'd do.
Go the other way.

528
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,643
More cubicles.

529
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:27,245
More division.

530
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:31,149
Everyone is somebody's boss,

531
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:34,819
and that person can fire

That's what I'd do.

00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,545
legally changed my name,
learned French sign language,

708
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:25,081
shown up, and been the best
damn branch manager

709
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:26,482
you'd ever seen.

710
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,184
All that for this job.

711
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:29,752
Yes.

712
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:32,922
That's [Bleep] Crazy.

713
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,625
Get outta here.

714
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:41,397
What a nut job.

715
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:46,451
This guy was good,
although he did keep saying

716
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,420
that he needed two weeks off
right at the beginning

717
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:49,788
for a trip to the Finger Lakes.

718
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,589
Seriously, every five minutes
he was like,

719
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:53,458
"hey, just making sure the
Finger Lakes thing is clear."

720
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:55,460
Okay. It's fun to talk
about the rejects,

721
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:57,262
but, uh...
Who's got ya excited?

722
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:58,730
Finger Lakes guy is good.

723
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,099
Darryl is also very good.

724
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:04,502
Who's this fellow?
Went to Cornell.

725
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,172
What's wrong with him?
How much time do you have?

726
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,807
Sales ability--none.

727
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:11,676
Integrity:
See sales ability.

728
00:29:11,744 --> 00:29:13,311
And that's your unbiased
opinion.

729
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,846
- Yes, it is.
- So it's not relevant

730
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:18,016
that he took the receptionist
away from ya.

731
00:29:18,084 --> 00:29:20,485
Aw, Jo.
Jo, I'm disappointed in you.

732
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:23,254
Some people let personal
things into the work--

733
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:25,223
is she with him?
Because I-I thought that--

734
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,659
- Gabe!
Ohh!

735
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,127
You got all close
to these people,

736
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:31,429
got involved in their lives.

737
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:32,664
Let's get ya back to Florida.

738
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,632
We'll figure out
something for ya.

739
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,067
That sounds like a promotion.

740
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:38,002
It's not.

741
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,737
Let's get Kelly in here
to take his place.

742
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:41,306
Um...Why Kelly?

743
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:43,475
'Cause Gabe's tall and weak.
She's short and strong.

744
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,243
I'm doing an opposites thing.

745
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:46,644
[Whispers] Okay.

746
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:48,079
How'd my girl Nelly do?

747
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:49,681
Oh. I didn't know
you knew her.

748
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,816
- She didn't mention it?
- No.

749
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:54,285
Integrity move.
I like it.

750
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:56,187
Yeah, uh, she also
gave me reason to think

751
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,189
that maybe she wasn't
a good fit.

752
00:29:58,257 --> 00:29:59,858
Well, I'm not saying
you must hire her.

753
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:03,128
If you find someone
who's clearly a fit, then fine.

754
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:05,463
Just make sure
they fit real good.

755
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:08,333
No more manager turnover.
Don't mess this up, Jim.

756
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:11,469
And give Dwight an interview.

757
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,972
I like a little bit of crazy.

758
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,344
- Ah!
- Erin, what are you doing?

759
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:21,479
I've been turned into a puppet.

760
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:23,615
- Okay.
- [Giggling]

761
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:25,517
Look at the puppet.
Hi, puppet.

762
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:26,951
Who are you?

763
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,020
I went to drop off
the FedEx forms,

764
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:33,324
and an evil witch named Angela
turned me into a puppet!

765
00:30:33,392 --> 00:30:35,193
[Kevin laughing] Yeah.

766
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:37,028
Low blow, puppet.

767
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:39,397
And there's only one thing
that can change me back

768
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:41,699
into a real girl.

769
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:44,269
It's good.

770
00:30:44,336 --> 00:30:45,837
It's just that
I wish the puppet

771
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:48,106
would talk more about
the alphabet.

772
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:50,542
Not for me, but...

773
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:52,544
If any kids are watching.

774
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:56,481
A, b, and so forth.

775
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:58,249
You know.

776
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:02,387
M, N, L, O. P.

777
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:05,657
F.

778
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:08,726
I need the most
special thing in the office.

779
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:10,061
Silence?

780
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:13,231
A date with
the best salesman...

781
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:15,200
Andy Bernard!

782
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,604
[Giggles]

783
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:27,212
Hey, Erin.
Oh.

784
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,913
Where'd you learn
how to puppet like that?

785
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:31,115
- I've done it all my life--
- Listen, I'm really flattered,

786
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,051
but I don't think we should.

787
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:41,359
Erin's my best friend
in this office,

788
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:43,628
hands down.

789
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:44,829
But...

790
00:31:44,897 --> 00:31:46,097
When she asked me out,

791
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:48,433
I just didn't have
that feeling, you know?

792
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,501
Aren't there some things
that you really want to like

793
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:53,605
but you just can't
seem to like it?

794
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:57,408
<i>Like Mad Men or football.</i>

795
00:31:57,476 --> 00:31:59,577
Let's not forget.
Erin chose Gabe over me.

796
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:01,879
That happened.

797
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:06,417
I'm not gonna apologize
for getting over her...Okay?

798
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:08,353
I'm sorry.

799
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,824
I would go for someone
who's more...

800
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,760
She's great, though.

801
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:17,862
Stanley,
I won't be able to invite

802
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,530
everyone to the wedding,

803
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:21,599
because we wanna keep it
to 350.

804
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,401
- I'll get over it.
- I mean,

805
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:25,069
we just have to see
how many senators

806
00:32:25,137 --> 00:32:26,871
and members of congress
want to attend

807
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:30,341
before we can open it up
to regular people.

808
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:33,344
Pam, you know how you and Jim
did your ironic wedding?

809
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:34,879
Do you still have the plans

810
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:36,547
for the dream wedding
that you couldn't afford?

811
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:38,416
That was our dream wedding.

812
00:32:38,484 --> 00:32:41,119
Niagara falls?

813
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:44,255
Pregnant?
That was your dream?

814
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:46,457
Pork medallions?

815
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:50,194
I hope...

816
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:53,131
You have a very beautiful
wedding, Angela.

817
00:32:53,198 --> 00:32:55,066
Hmm.

818
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:57,135
All right.

819
00:32:57,202 --> 00:32:58,903
Name.
Dwight Schrute.

820
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:01,072
Thank you, Mr. Scnoot.
We will let you know.

821
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,907
- You have to interview me.
- I just did.

822
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:04,275
The answer to that one question

823
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:05,610
told me everything
I need to know.

824
00:33:05,678 --> 00:33:06,878
I demand more questions!

825
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:08,212
All right, guys.
Good day.

826
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,714
A lot of candidates.
Let's discuss.

827
00:33:09,782 --> 00:33:11,449
Okay. If you're not gonna
interview me,

828
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:12,950
then I'll do it.
Yes.

829
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:15,753
What will be
your first priority?

830
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:19,324
I will have seven
first priorities.

831
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:21,626
Safety, profits,

832
00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:24,062
fostering a community
of self-reliance

833
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:25,763
and entrepreneurship,

834
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:26,764
listening,

835
00:33:26,832 --> 00:33:29,133
respect for human life,

836
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:30,635
bolstering our public image,

837
00:33:30,703 --> 00:33:34,906
and...[Chuckles]
Getting everyone home on time.

838
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,307
Dwight, let me be Frank.

839
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,409
In an accident
that no one can blame you for,

840
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:41,579
an antique gun was discharged
while you were acting manager.

841
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,482
How are we ever
to trust you again?

842
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,454
[Quietly]
That's a great question.

843
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:51,723
I am going to institute

844
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,259
a strict no firearms policy
for this office

845
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:58,029
that extends to myself as well.

846
00:33:58,097 --> 00:34:01,366
Wow. All of my concerns
are disappearing.

847
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,301
- Thank you, Dwight.
- Thank you.

848
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:07,338
[Ahem]

849
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:09,974
You'll be hearing from us
shortly, Mr. Schrute,

850
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:11,976
and I think you're going to
like the call

851
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:13,878
you're going to receive.

852
00:34:13,946 --> 00:34:16,881
Oh, come on.

853
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,851
I'm just happy
that I got this meeting.

854
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:23,855
[Door closes]

855
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:25,056
Well, that was quick.

856
00:34:25,124 --> 00:34:27,892
[Exhales]
Very, very interesting.

857
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,129
And you know what?
I'm impressed.

858
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:33,498
- He's not a real candidate.
- I don't know, Jim,

859
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:34,899
'cause it makes me think
about something

860
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,367
that my grandfather
used to say, which is that

861
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:39,003
sometimes the hand
that jumps out of the grave

862
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:40,505
and grabs you around the throat,

863
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:42,974
that is the hand
that you want on the wheel.

864
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,076
- You took the deal.
- Yeah. It was a great deal.

865
00:34:45,144 --> 00:34:46,711
- That's not okay.
- I don't know.

866
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:48,713
Dwight seems like
a great leader to me,

867
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:50,381
and I look forward
to the personal perks

868
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,849
that he promised me privately.

869
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:53,184
What do you think, Toby?

870
00:34:53,252 --> 00:34:55,253
Well, we could try him out
for a little while.

871
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,488
If it doesn't work out,
you know,

872
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,057
maybe one of us could,
you know, step in...

873
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:02,427
What is happening right now?

874
00:35:04,762 --> 00:35:06,778
Is it true that you're
making Dwight the manager?

875
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,317
No. Why would you
think that?

876
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:10,319
Well, he and Kelly said,
then they pre-fired me.

877
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:11,387
Okay.

878
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:15,558
Okay, guys,
just so you all know,

879
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,493
no decision has been made.

880
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:19,328
And Dwight is definitely
not the boss.

881
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:20,396
That is correct.

882
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:22,398
Actually, Dwight is not
the manager yet.

883
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:24,767
No, no, no, not-- Not ever,
'cause that's not gonna happen.

884
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:26,869
Well, it's not entirely
up to you, is it?

885
00:35:26,937 --> 00:35:29,538
Seems to me like someone
is getting a little power mad.

886
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:30,773
Am I the only one who remembers

887
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:32,174
what he did
when he was in charge?

888
00:35:32,242 --> 00:35:34,410
I feel like I'm going
a little bit crazy.

889
00:35:34,478 --> 00:35:35,878
Tuna...
You're completely sane.

890
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:38,381
- Thank you.
- Who do you like for the job?

891
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:40,282
Is there anyone who maybe

892
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,951
was a little underwhelming
at first

893
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:43,652
but now seems like a safe...

894
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,689
If not slightly unexciting
choice?

895
00:35:46,757 --> 00:35:50,226
Okay. It seems like everybody
has an opinion, so who else?

896
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:51,927
Anybody?
Do you mean it?

897
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:53,796
Anybody?
Are you sure?

898
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:55,631
[Wearily] I suppose I am.

899
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:59,201
Okay. Well, what do I want
in a manager?

900
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:01,704
Let me see.

901
00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:05,141
<i>What do I want?</i>

902
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,243
I don't think he meant--

903
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,612
So now anyone gets to talk
at any time?

904
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,247
Go ahead.

905
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:14,383
What do I want?

906
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:18,621
I'm looking for someone

907
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:19,955
who...

908
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,926
Everyone is listening to me.

909
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:26,262
- Can I say--
- Yes.

910
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:27,830
I think it should be Darryl.

911
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:29,398
- Okay.
- What a surprise.

912
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:31,934
Minorities sticking together.
Kelly's on your side.

913
00:36:32,002 --> 00:36:34,637
I'm sorry, is that all
you think of me-- A minority?

914
00:36:34,704 --> 00:36:36,739
I am so much more than that.

915
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:38,507
I am a dancer.
I'm a singer.

916
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:39,942
I'm a fashion designer.

917
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,878
Whoever it is,
I think they should be lame.

918
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:46,649
Kind of a nonthreatening,
moderate personality.

919
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:48,050
- I want an outsider.
- Perfect.

920
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:51,520
There are several outside
candidates that we think--

921
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:52,855
No, I mean an outsider.

922
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:54,690
Like someone
on the margins of society

923
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:57,059
who doesn't see things
the way we do,

924
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,661
like a homeless person.
A homeless person.

925
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:01,330
Really?
A homeless person.

926
00:37:01,398 --> 00:37:02,832
No. You're right, Pam.

927
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:04,300
Let's just leave them
to the welfare system

928
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:06,202
and let that handle it.
No, I want you to say

929
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:08,838
that you think the best person
to be our new manager

930
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:10,172
is a homeless person.

931
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,007
Let me guess who you want, Pam.

932
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:13,742
<i>Rachael ray?
The ladies of the view?</i>

933
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:18,214
I got away with everything
under the last boss,

934
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:20,182
and it wasn't good for me
at all.

935
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,853
So I want guidance.
I want leadership.

936
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,856
But don't just like
boss me around, you know?

937
00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:28,491
Like lead me.

938
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:31,827
Lead me...
When I'm in the mood

939
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:33,529
to be led.

940
00:37:33,597 --> 00:37:35,030
I just want for once

941
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:37,566
a small, professional,
decisive,

942
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:39,535
well-hung man
in his 40s.

943
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:41,237
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Okay, fine.

944
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:43,472
Uh, the guy with a tiny penis.

945
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,142
<i>Are you happy?
Let's hire that guy!</i>

946
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,644
She may have a point there.

947
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:51,547
Would a small penis work?

948
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:53,482
Small to moderate.

949
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,817
Gotta catch a plane.

950
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:56,585
Oh, hey, Gabe, I'm sorry.

951
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:58,220
We didn't get you
a cake or anything.

952
00:37:58,288 --> 00:37:59,655
We're gonna miss you.

953
00:37:59,723 --> 00:38:02,558
Oh, well, I'm still the
corporate liaison to the branch.

954
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:04,994
You are not leaving
without giving me a hug.

955
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:06,228
[Both chuckle]

956
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:08,063
Ugh!
Okay, you know what?

957
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:09,398
You don't need
to make that sound.

958
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:10,799
I'm sorry.
You were just a lot bonier

959
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:12,167
than I thought
you were gonna be!

960
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:14,036
There are plenty of people
who love touching me.

961
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:15,538
I'm a terrific hugger.

962
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:17,039
I've been with a bunch of girls

963
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:19,575
where that's basically
all they wanna do.

964
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:21,677
I will see you all soon.
Later, man.

965
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:23,245
- Good luck.
- We'll miss you.

966
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:24,747
Good luck at your new job.

967
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:26,282
Uh, listen up.
[Ahem]

968
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:28,083
Listen up, ladies.

969
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:30,586
I want the job.

970
00:38:30,654 --> 00:38:32,521
There. I said it.

971
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:34,490
I'm educated.
I'm capable.

972
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:39,528
I like all of you,
and I won't make any changes.

973
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:41,363
I see it.

974
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:44,233
I see it like I see a Mountain
that I'm standing in front of

975
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:46,268
and facing and I'm liking.

976
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:47,670
Yeah.

977
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:49,905
Andy would be wonderful
as boss.

978
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:52,241
Erin made a good point.

979
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:56,045
No. We're not related.
I got the call.

980
00:38:56,112 --> 00:38:59,515
But...
I'll tell her some other day.

981
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,250
What about Darryl?

982
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:04,286
We can all agree
that he's a stand-up guy, right?

983
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:06,388
Well, let me be clear.
I only speak for myself

984
00:39:06,456 --> 00:39:08,791
and not myself and the senator.

985
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:10,893
I think we have
some wonderful candidates,

986
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:13,262
and there is a great
lively debate here.

987
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,397
But let's think about--
- No. No.

988
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:18,067
No. Sorry. We cut Kevin off
for the same thing.

989
00:39:18,134 --> 00:39:20,102
You have to have something
to say if you talk.

990
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,104
Exactly.

991
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:24,106
Jada. No, no, no.
Jada, what are you do--

992
00:39:24,174 --> 00:39:26,208
Oh. So sorry, guys.

993
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:28,811
I hope my family
didn't disrupt your meeting.

994
00:39:28,878 --> 00:39:31,614
Daddy, are these the people
who are making you manager?

995
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:34,883
Maybe, sweetheart.
[Sighs]

996
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:36,986
Single dad.
Challenges.

997
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:39,955
I don't know
if he'd be a good manager,

998
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:41,457
but he's a really great dad.

999
00:39:41,524 --> 00:39:43,292
Okay. Shush.
This was a mistake.

1000
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,560
Let's go.

1001
00:39:44,628 --> 00:39:47,129
It seems like
we all know enough to vote.

1002
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:49,598
Should just vote now?
What? No, no, no.

1003
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:50,899
It's not a vote.
Then what was this all about?

1004
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:52,067
I don't know.

1005
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:53,502
This conversation
really got away from me.

1006
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,004
I don't care.
They can just vote.

1007
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:56,672
No, they can't.

1008
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,474
That's not how
this is gonna work.

1009
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,908
[Exhales]
We're going in this room.

1010
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:01,410
We're gonna have a meeting.

1011
00:40:01,478 --> 00:40:03,312
We're gonna make
a recommendation to Jo,

1012
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,881
and she's gonna give you her
recommendation on Monday, okay?

1013
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:08,050
What the hell happened
out there?

1014
00:40:12,122 --> 00:40:15,257
Sometimes you hear people
talking about failing upwards.

1015
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:18,694
I think I'm about to do that.

1016
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:21,530
This job?
Oh, yeah, I'll get it.

1017
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:23,732
Jo's an old friend.

1018
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,835
I think...
I'm her best friend.

1019
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:28,671
She's not my best friend.

1020
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:30,572
Every day,
I have a blueberry muffin.

1021
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,575
Today I did not have
a blueberry muffin.

1022
00:40:33,643 --> 00:40:36,278
Should have had
the blueberry muffin.

1023
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:39,715
Especially considering how
incredibly superstitious I am.

1024
00:40:39,783 --> 00:40:42,584
No. I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

1025
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:46,221
I will be the new boss of...

1026
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:48,691
Vance refrigeration.

1027
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:51,527
Honestly, I think I--
I sabotaged myself.

1028
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:55,431
It's like I'm afraid
of being happy.

1029
00:40:55,498 --> 00:40:57,433
Case in point...

1030
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,002
I was supposed to start
another job today.

1031
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,538
[Laughs] I will get
offered the job.

1032
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:05,607
That's a...Call I've received
many times.

1033
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:08,610
The slight...
Hopefulness in their voice,

1034
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:10,979
the pregnant pause
while they...

1035
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:13,382
Wait to hear my response.

1036
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,385
And then...
My response.

1037
00:41:17,654 --> 00:41:18,787
[Geeky voice] I want the job.

1038
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:20,489
I really do.

1039
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:21,890
It's just the rest
of my family's

1040
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,425
in the Finger Lakes right now.

1041
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:26,161
I'm supposed to be
in the Finger Lakes right now.

1042
00:41:26,229 --> 00:41:29,631
I told 'em I was on a hike,
snuck away to do this interview.

1043
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:32,568
I gotta get back pretty soon.
They'll worry.

1044
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:34,703
People disappear
in the Finger Lakes.

1045
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:36,972
I will run this branch

1046
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,977
or I will destroy this branch.

1047
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:44,179
Or...I don't know.

1048
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:46,048
Something always works out.

Sync by n17t01

1050
00:41:57,633 --> 00:41:59,934
You remind me so much
of my fourth biggest client.

1051
00:42:00,002 --> 00:42:01,169
[High voice] Is that right?

1052
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:02,637
I think you two should meet.

1053
00:42:02,705 --> 00:42:04,605
Well, okay...

1054
