1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:05,060
Okay, where does it hurt?

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,197
Just... All over.

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,709
I don't want to do anything. I'm dying.

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:11,766
No, that's not how it works.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,040
You have to point
to a specific part of the body.

6
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,245
Right there.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,076
DWIGHT: Abdomen.

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,212
Menses.
Maybe.

9
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,447
"The uterus contracts
after your egg passes through it."

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,012
Not it, I don't have eggs.

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,751
So when did this start?

12
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,591
About 10 minutes ago. I don't...
When I came in with the paperwork?

13
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,095
About 40 times a year,

14
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,598
Michael gets really sick
but has no symptoms.

15
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,401
Dwight is always gravely concerned.

16
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,405
DWIGHT: Is it possible you ate food
that contained animal waste?

17
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,205
It's possible.

18
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,503
PAM: Michael?

19
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,373
David Wallace is on line one.

20
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,503
CFO?

21
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,507
All right, everybody out. Out, out, out.

22
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:51,941
Okay.

23
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,646
To what do I owe this great honor,
David Wallace?

24
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,281
<i>DAVID: Michael, I am calling to see...</i>
And Gromit.

25
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,190
Jan? Is Jan there?

26
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,692
<i>Jan is out of town right now.</i>
Oh. You sigh like Jan.

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,227
I broke Jan's heart, David.
And I feel awful. It was...

28
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:16,031
It was never my intention to ruin a life.
But you know what?

29
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,077
Sometimes...
<i>Michael?</i>

30
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,807
...you just gots to get your freak on.
<i>Michael?</i>

31
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,542
Yeah?
<i>Michael?</i>

32
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,712
<i>I am calling to see if you would come down</i>

33
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,381
<i>and interview for a job we have opening up</i>
<i>in corporate.</i>

34
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,888
Really?
<i>A week from today.</i>

35
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,221
<i>Bring your first quarter stats</i>

36
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,354
<i>and your recommendation</i>
<i>for who'd take over the Scranton branch.</i>

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,658
Wow.

38
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:42,093
I wish I had prepared something to say.

39
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,565
<i>That's not necessary.</i>
May God guide you in your quest.

40
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,432
<i>Yes.</i>

41
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,570
Okay. Everybody have
their towels and swimsuits?

42
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,547
We've got an hour and a half.
I suggest that you all go potty now,

43
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,676
and then we will be congregating
on the party bus.

44
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,652
Oh, I'm excited. Today is Beach Day.

45
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,053
Michael is taking the whole office
to the beach.

46
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,183
So I'm wearing my bathing suit
underneath my shirt.

47
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,694
Oh, yeah. I packed it in my purse.

48
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,954
Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?

49
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:50,196
I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
Well, you can't swim in leather pants.

50
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,036
I'm just yanking your chain.

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,605
Not literally.

52
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,166
Anybody need sun block? I've got SPF 30.

53
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,902
Oh. You know what? You're not going.

54
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,842
It's Beach Day.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

55
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,315
Toby, we...

56
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,511
Somebody has to stay here.

57
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:13,287
I want today to be a beautiful memory
that the staff and I share

58
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,760
after I have passed on to New York.

59
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,824
And if Toby's a part of it, then it'll suck.

60
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,595
Hey. You want my sunscreen?

61
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,336
Oh, great.

62
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,505
I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two-piece.

63
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,744
Thanks, Toby.

64
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,446
Hey, Pam.
I have a very important job for you today.

65
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,347
I thought we were just having fun
at the beach.

66
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,414
We are. We are.
But I would like you to take notes.

67
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,221
And I want you to find out
about people's character.

68
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,286
You know, not their hotness, per se,

69
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,595
but their humor and their charisma,

70
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:59,195
and the indefinable quality
that makes you all glad to follow me.

71
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,370
What happens to a company
if somebody takes a boss away?

72
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,638
I will answer your question with a question.

73
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:10,843
It's like what happens to a chicken
when you take its head away.

74
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,814
It dies.

75
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,277
Unless you find a new head.

76
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:22,984
I need to see which one of these people
have the skills to be a chicken head.

77
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,288
You want me to write down
people's indefinable qualities?

78
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,426
I want you to write down everything
that people are doing all day

79
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,029
and then type it up in a way that is helpful.
All right?

80
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,898
I have the most boring job in the office.

81
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,968
So why wouldn't I have
the most boring job on Beach Day?

82
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,849
This way to the party bus.

83
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,078
I just want to lie on the beach
and eat hot dogs.

84
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,651
That's all I've ever wanted.

85
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,386
<i>(SINGING) And the night got deathly quiet</i>

86
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,722
<i>And his face lost all expression</i>

87
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,923
<i>Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy</i>

88
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:02,092
<i>"You gotta learn to play it right</i>

89
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,695
<i>ALL: "You got to know when to hold 'em</i>

90
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,670
<i>"Know when to fold 'em"</i>

91
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,730
Yeah.

92
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,905
<i>"Know when to walk away</i>
<i>Know when to run</i>

93
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,676
<i>"You never count your money</i>

94
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,049
<i>"When you're sitting at the table</i>

95
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,580
<i>"There'll be time enough for counting</i>

96
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,025
<i>"When the dealing's done"</i>

97
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:32,857
Everybody, may I have
your attention, please?

98
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,860
Today, we are not just
spending a day at the beach.

99
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,868
Oh, sweet mother of God.

100
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,134
If you don't like it, Stanley,
you can go to the back of the bus.

101
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:46,645
Excuse me?
Or the front of the bus or drive the bus.

102
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,878
Just...

103
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:53,749
We are all participating
in mandatory fun activities.

104
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,352
Funtivities.

105
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,585
And there is a special secret prize
for the winner.

106
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,819
<i>Yes! Funtivities!</i>

107
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,326
I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.

108
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,853
Okay, you know what?
Your enthusiasm's turning people off.

109
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,366
I hope there will be management parables.
Well...

110
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,598
Hey, Pam. Did you get that down?
Like what?

111
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,505
Like everything I said
and everything they did, and just...

112
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,941
I don't know exactly...
Don't... Write it down before you forget it.

113
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,502
That's... You've just been drawing pictures.

114
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,476
(GRUNTS)

115
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,710
I can't stay mad at you.

116
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,878
MICHAEL: Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.

117
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,720
Everybody ready?
Last one down is a rotten egg.

118
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,022
Watch out for snakes.

119
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,091
Everybody, put on sunscreen.

120
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:42,100
All right. Find a cozy spot.
Everybody, settle in.

121
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,105
Okay, everybody up. Circle around.

122
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,909
Let us play some games.

123
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:59,173
We are situated on the northeast corner
of scenic Lake Scranton,

124
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,419
America's eighth-largest
indigenous body of water.

125
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:09,393
It is here that a group of Americans
will undergo the ultimate challenge.

126
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,161
One day,
fourteen strangers who work together,

127
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,491
but only one survivor.
What?

128
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:21,202
Just words. Inspiring words.
Not a contender.

129
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,942
For the competitions,
you will be divided into four tribes.

130
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,740
Each tribe will have a leader

131
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,408
that I will pick randomly
off the top of my head without thinking.

132
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,445
Jim, Dwight, Andy, and Stanley.

133
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,214
<i>Yes!</i>
Choose your tribes.

134
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,256
Except for Pam, not Pam.

135
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,192
Jim Halpert.
Karen.

136
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,821
<i>MICHAEL: Pros: Smart, cool, good-Iooking.</i>

137
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,389
Remind you of anybody you know?

138
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,332
Cons: Not a hard worker.

139
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,634
I can spend all day on a project,

140
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,573
and he will finish the same project
in half an hour.

141
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,166
So that should tell you something.

142
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,871
I choose <i>Michael!</i>

143
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,405
I'm not playing.

144
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,280
Okay. Temp.

145
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,653
Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job.

146
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:12,087
He has the best sales record in the office.
He loves the work.

147
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,794
He is, however, an idiot.

148
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,989
We are going to choose
team names. Dwight.

149
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,295
We will be called Gryffindor.
Really? Not Slytherin?

150
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,595
Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.

151
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,035
I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.

152
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,535
He Who Must Not Be Named?
I wouldn't do that.

153
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,043
Voldemort. Voldemort.
Okay, seriously...

154
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,579
ALL: Voldemort. Voldemort.
...you really shouldn't be saying...

155
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,945
Voldemort. Voldemort.
Idiots. Idiots.

156
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,450
Okay, okay. Stanley, your team name?

157
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,282
I don't care what you call my team.

158
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,652
Then I will name your team the Red Team.

159
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,384
No, the Blue Team.

160
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:50,321
I am also considering Stanley
because of all the good

161
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,622
that black people have done for America.

162
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,230
We will be Team USA.

163
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,635
Very good. Pam, please, take a note
that Andy is patriotic.

164
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,739
Andy Bernard.
Pros: He's classy, he gets me.

165
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,337
He went to Cornell. I trust him.

166
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,173
Cons: I don't really trust him.

167
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,855
It is time for the great spoon and egg race.
This one is with a little twist.

168
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,450
There's already a twist,
you're carrying an egg on a spoon.

169
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,086
The person carrying the egg
will be blindfolded.

170
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,561
Please, put on your blindfolds.

171
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,565
That person carrying the egg
will go down, circle a torch,

172
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,466
come back, deposit their egg in the pail.

173
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:35,739
First team back is the winner.
All right, ready, set, <i>go!</i>

174
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,201
Come on, Phyllis, you can do it.

175
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,272
Thank you so much.

176
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,837
Phyllis is out. <i>Yes!</i> Follow my voice.
Follow my voice.

177
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,112
Yeah, keep it moving,
keep it moving right this way.

178
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,050
Looking good.
KELLY: I don't want to hit the big rock.

179
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,178
Don't worry, you're not...

180
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,780
I know I'm near the big rock, I just know it.
Nowhere near the big rock.

181
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:52,915
Andy, I don't wanna get hurt
by the big rock.

182
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,653
What are you doing? <i>No!</i>

183
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,326
See, now we're disqualified.

184
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:03,127
I am okay if I lose
every single contest today.

185
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,592
Honestly.

186
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,002
Because I see these contests

187
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:13,068
as an opportunity for me to demonstrate
what a good sport I am.

188
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,373
Mallard.

189
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,942
Stop, stop, stop. There's a hole.
DWIGHT: Move <i>it!</i>

190
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,041
Just step over the hole.
DWIGHT: Move your <i>ass!</i>

191
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,110
Yup.
Come on, <i>lazy-bones!</i> Move <i>it!</i> Come <i>on!</i>

192
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,452
Perfect. Just made it. Okay, turn left.
Come <i>on!</i>

193
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,956
Come <i>on! Andale, Andale! Arriba!</i>

194
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,255
You have to stop this right now
or I'm not gonna do this anymore.

195
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,760
What are you saying?
You have to stop yelling at me

196
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:30,921
or I'm not gonna do the egg race.

197
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,089
Okay, I apologize for yelling at you.

198
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,153
That's what being a good captain is about.

199
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,530
I'm trying to bring team <i>spirit!</i>
It's about listening to your team.

200
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,262
Whoa, stop. Another hole. Take a big step.

201
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,735
DWIGHT: I am not hysterical.
I am explaining...

202
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,862
<i>Yes!</i>

203
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,236
Oh, my God. You ass.

204
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,832
(BOTH LAUGHING)

205
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,010
There's nothing better
than a beautiful day at the beach,

206
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,073
filled with sun, surf
and diligent note-taking.

207
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,613
MICHAEL: Pam, you're missing <i>things!</i>

208
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:11,369
Let's <i>go!</i> Let's <i>go!</i> Come <i>on! Mush! Mush!</i>

209
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,530
Come on, you <i>bastard!</i> What the...

210
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,264
Damn it, <i>temp!</i>

211
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,640
Great job, everyone, that was fantastic.

212
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,213
Okay, Pam, I have
another little project for you.

213
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,811
Does it have to do with these shopping bags
filled with hot dogs?

214
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,878
Smart as a <i>whip!</i> Yes.

215
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,255
These are pre-cooked,
so it's not absolutely necessary,

216
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,056
but I would appreciate it
if you could heat up 800 hot dogs

217
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,826
for a little contest I'm going to be having.
I would greatly appreciate it.

218
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,767
When's the contest?
Like, 10 minutes?

219
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,396
How am I supposed to get...
Thanks a bunch.

220
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:53,438
A good manager has got to be hungry.
Hungry for success.

221
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,841
Okay, who's hungry?

222
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,348
No, no, no, do not touch the food.
Please, not yet.

223
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,515
That is our next event.
A hot dog-eating contest.

224
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,780
STANLEY: Oh, God.

225
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,048
For those of you who are curious,

226
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:07,525
the world record
is 54 and one half hot dogs.

227
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,788
Wow. And you know what?

228
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,023
I personally have cooked up enough

229
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,157
so that each and every one of you
could break that record.

230
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,929
So shoot for the stars, okay? All <i>right!</i>

231
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:21,129
The team that eats the most hot dogs
in 10 minutes will be declared the <i>winner!</i>

232
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,198
On your mark, get set...

233
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:27,109
Can I have a turkey burger?
No. I have the only one. I claimed it.

234
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,976
Ready?
OSCAR: Turkey is a healthy meat.

235
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,310
RYAN: Yeah, it's very good for you.

236
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,509
I don't eat meat, Michael.
I'm not gonna eat this.

237
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,882
JIM: It has L-tryptophan.
Guys, guys.

238
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,215
Come on...
KEVIN: What's L-tryptophan?

239
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,720
<i>Please!</i> Let's just...

240
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,919
Okay, it's very important that you all
try to eat as many hot dogs as you can.

241
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,759
On your mark, get set, <i>eat!</i>

242
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,460
Is there any mustard?
No <i>mustard!</i> No <i>mustard!</i> Just eat <i>it!</i>

243
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,904
Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water
so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.

244
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,735
Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
What is it?

245
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,573
I can't say.
You can't say? Or you can't pronounce it?

246
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,445
The winner gets regional manager salary
for a year and a Sebring

247
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,677
and the feeling that they're making
a difference in the world.

248
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,979
Can we just take those first two things?

249
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,283
The winner of today gets my job.

250
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:15,257
Okay? I'm interviewing
for a job at corporate.

251
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,061
And they're only interviewing
a handful of people,

252
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,032
and I'm the most qualified,
and I'll probably get it, all right?

253
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,859
You're leaving?
I didn't wanna tell anybody.

254
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,872
I didn't wanna cast a pall
over our fun Beach Day.

255
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,464
But you know what?
I don't know who to recommend,

256
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,840
because, frankly, nobody's stepping up.

257
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,835
I am so hungry.

258
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,572
Do you expect me to believe

259
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,947
that you're truly making
your recommendations on this basis?

260
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,607
Word.

261
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,622
Here we go. Let's see it.

262
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,251
I would rather work for an upturned broom
with a bucket for a head

263
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:53,162
than work for somebody else in this office
besides myself. Game on.

264
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:57,464
RYAN: Come on. Come on.
Four seconds. Three, two, one...

265
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,561
Stop your <i>eating!</i>

266
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,801
And the winner is Andy Bernard...
KELLY: Team <i>USA!</i>

267
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,536
...with 1 4 hot <i>dogs!</i>

268
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,205
One came up.

269
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,246
Thirteen hot dogs, everybody.

270
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,713
Damn <i>it!</i>

271
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,980
Nobody told me
we were gonna have hot dogs.

272
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,718
Sabotage.

273
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,317
What? What are you saying?
Did you say sandwich?

274
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:27,798
No. I was saying that before. Not now.
Now I am saying sabotage.

275
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,899
The ancient Dutch art of screwing up
your own team.

276
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:37,068
I knew you were saying sabotage.
I was giving you an example of it.

277
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,074
I will misunderstand everything
that Andy says until he goes insane.

278
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,377
If Michael organizes
some kind of group hug,

279
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,707
stand next to me.

280
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,245
It's very simple. There are only three rules.

281
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:55,488
You must not touch the ground.
You must not step outside of the ring.

282
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,962
And you must always
wear the safety mittens.

283
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,864
We don't have any safety mittens.

284
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,834
Probably left them in the trunk of my car.
It's all right. Here we go.

285
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,268
Get him, big <i>boy!</i>

286
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,266
And <i>go!</i>

287
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,575
KAREN: Come on, <i>Jim!</i> Come <i>on!</i>
What are you doing?

288
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,405
KAREN: Come <i>on!</i>
Stop.

289
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,077
(ALL SHOUTING)

290
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,275
MICHAEL: Nice, <i>Stanley!</i>

291
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,207
STANLEY: Sorry about that.

292
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,150
It's all about taking points away
from Dwight.

293
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,415
Yeah. No. Good. Okay.

294
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,318
Oh, my God.

295
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,293
I have never seen that look
in a man's eyes, ever.

296
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,298
I thought that I might die. On Beach Day.

297
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,997
Come <i>on!</i> Come <i>on!</i>
Come <i>on!</i>

298
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,007
OSCAR: If either of these guys are put
in charge of the office,

299
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,303
I will transfer to Albany.

300
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,570
Gil can come if he wants.

301
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,613
I'm kind of looking for a way out
of that relationship, anyway.

302
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:54,247
I think I might try girls for a while.
Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.

303
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,709
(GRUNTING)

304
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,580
One, two, <i>three!</i>

305
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,521
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

306
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,922
MICHAEL: <i>Excellent!</i>

307
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,188
<i>Gryffindor!</i>
CREED: <i>Gryffindor!</i>

308
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,320
KELLY: Come <i>on!</i>

309
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,259
I didn't win.

310
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,665
But the only reason I didn't win is
because I recently learned

311
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,999
that it's better
to work things out with words.

312
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,039
That's not why you lost.

313
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,267
Yeah, it is.
I totally could have kicked your butt.

314
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,776
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, right.

315
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,541
Yeah, <i>right!</i> Come on, come <i>on!</i>
<i>God!</i>

316
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,944
(YELLING)

317
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,683
How do you like that?

318
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,022
(GRUNTING)

319
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,827
Help. <i>Help! Angela!</i> Angela, hey.

320
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,134
Oh, thank God. Go tell somebody.

321
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,605
What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them?

322
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,168
Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously.

323
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,612
I don't understand what you want from me.

324
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,149
Angela, it's pretty simple.

325
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,616
Look at what I'm doing
and go tell somebody <i>it!</i>

326
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,243
<i>Sorry!</i>

327
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,390
Bye, <i>Andy!</i>

328
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,652
<i>Angela!</i>

329
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,522
I knew that finding a successor
would be difficult.

330
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,429
I did not know that it would be impossible.

331
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,157
Thus far the candidates
have been wildly disappointing.

332
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,102
Jim is not taking it seriously.
Stanley is having a stroke.

333
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,971
And Andy, where is he?
Where the hell is Andy?

334
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,835
Where is he, Pam? Do you know?

335
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,805
Who's ahead in points?
I think they're even.

336
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,081
At various times you gave Jim 10 points,

337
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,385
Dwight a gold star,
and Stanley a thumbs-up.

338
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,416
And I don't really know
how to compare those units.

339
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,427
Well, check to see if there is
a conversion chart in that notebook.

340
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,225
I really doubt it, Michael.
Please, just check.

341
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,294
Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week.

342
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,701
Thank you. And here is Karen Filippelli. Bye.

343
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,340
Hello? Yeah, hi, David.

344
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,271
Yes, I would like to be considered
for the corporate position in well.

345
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,075
"In well"?
As well.

346
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,514
How would that work, in well?

347
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,379
I just want to know.
Yes.

348
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,943
Wait a minute.

349
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,887
That would be fine.
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.

350
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,185
I don't.

351
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:17,192
What does a great manager need
most of all?

352
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,456
Courage.
How so?

353
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,997
I mean, sure thing. That sounds smart.

354
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,061
I can't do this anymore.
I'm going to sit in the bus.

355
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,630
Your loss, Stanley.

356
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,905
Meanwhile, the rest of us will have
a super-fun time

357
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:36,539
defeating our fear
and creating a lasting memory

358
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,012
walking through <i>fire!</i>

359
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:49,754
Who among you has the guts to replace me?

360
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,820
Let him walk across these coals.

361
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,966
Are you gonna try it?

362
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,434
I'm not gonna walk in the fire after
your disgusting feet have gone through.

363
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,840
Angela, it is a million degrees.

364
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,268
I'm gonna do it.

365
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,282
And I fully expect to burn my feet
and go to the hospital.

366
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,644
That's the right spirit
when doing a coal walk, right?

367
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,985
No, no. Not you, Pam.
You have to keep score.

368
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,581
I'd like to try it.
Pointless.

369
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,183
But I'm not kidding, I really wanna do it.

370
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,456
Okay? This is about guts.

371
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,057
It takes guts to be a regional manager.

372
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,430
Jim, you're up.

373
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,694
Nope.
Why not? Come on.

374
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,763
Oh, 'cause I don't want
my feet to get burned.

375
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,976
You do not have what it takes
to be a regional manager.

376
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,304
That's harsh.

377
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:47,080
Who's next? Andy, where is Andy?
Andy is never here today.

378
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,517
Hello? Who's there?

379
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,321
My name is Andrew Bernard,
I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.

380
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:00,987
Hello?

381
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,666
Why don't you go, Michael?

382
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,899
Because I already did. Remember?
I burned my foot

383
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,940
on the George Foreman Grill.

384
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,533
That is not the same at all.

385
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,239
If you're gonna ask other people to do it,
you should do it yourself.

386
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,509
All right, okay. All right. Fine.

387
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,608
Okay.

388
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,752
(SIGHING)

389
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,818
Okay.

390
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:31,785
Go.

391
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:40,467
The mind has to wrap around the foot.

392
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,379
Okay.

393
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,464
You want us to count to three?

394
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,022
Yes, count to three, please.

395
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,729
Three, two, <i>one!</i>
ALL: Three, two, <i>one!</i>

396
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,929
Count the other way.
Go.

397
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,336
No, no. Count one, two, three.

398
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,135
Okay, okay.
Not three, two, one.

399
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,109
One, two, three.
ALL: One, two, three.

400
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,836
RYAN: <i>Go!</i> Do <i>it!</i>
DWIGHT: Go, Michael.

401
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,244
Wait. Am I going on "go"
or am I going on "three"?

402
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,408
KELLY: On <i>"three".</i>
DWIGHT: On the "go" that's after <i>"three".</i>

403
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,508
Okay.

404
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,316
ALL: One, two, three, <i>go!</i>
KELLY: One, two, three, <i>go!</i>

405
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,898
<i>No!</i> It's okay. I will do this, Michael.

406
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,003
Don't, Dwight...
I will walk and stand on these coals

407
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,268
until you award me
the position of regional <i>manager!</i>

408
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,211
Wow.
Yes.

409
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,512
KEVIN: Dwight.
KELLY: Dwight. Dwight.

410
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,048
KEVIN: Keep moving
if you're gonna walk there.

411
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,276
RYAN: Keep <i>moving!</i>

412
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,148
ANGELA: Keep coming.
Give me the <i>job!</i>

413
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,777
That's <i>enough!</i>
Give me the <i>job!</i>

414
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,879
I'm not going to give it to <i>you!</i>

415
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,024
Don't kneel on the <i>coals!</i>

416
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,286
Oh, my <i>God!</i>

417
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,157
PAM: Michael, do <i>something!</i>

418
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,287
God, that <i>stinks!</i>

419
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,329
KELLY: Dwight, stop <i>it!</i>

420
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,492
Being a boss is also about image.

421
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:22,101
I've never looked like that. That was gross.

422
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:27,976
I just... I don't see the connection
between a fire walk and management.

423
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,173
Worst $75 I ever spent.

424
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,548
You know what? If I had to pick
my replacement based on today,

425
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,315
it would be Mr. Outside Hire.

426
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,186
Or Mrs. Outside Hire.

427
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,884
Yeah. True.

428
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,821
Look, I don't...

429
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,429
I don't wanna leave this branch
that I love to an outside hire.

430
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:53,971
Therefore, we're going to have
a 100-point, winner-take-all,

431
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,437
sudden death, Tribal Council round

432
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,410
to test the aspect of my job

433
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:05,348
that I think is the most important,
something I call the Bob Hope factor.

434
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,049
KELLY: Who's Bob Hope?

435
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,111
God. He's... He's a comedian.

436
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,986
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
Who's Amanda Bynes?

437
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,516
She's from <i>What a Girl Wants.</i>
Oh, I love that movie.

438
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,085
Yes. Kelly is right.

439
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:23,294
The person to replace me has to have
a great sense of humor.

440
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,563
And they have to possess

441
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,834
the leadership qualities
of a Bynes or a Hope.

442
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:38,649
So, without further ado, Jim and Dwight.

443
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,781
Show us what you've got.

444
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:48,825
Hey. I know what you're looking for,
but I gotta be honest,

445
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,421
I really don't think I should be considered
as your replacement.

446
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,490
You are being too modest.

447
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,729
Michael, on Thursday, I'm gonna drive down
and interview with David

448
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,464
for the open position in New York.

449
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,973
Okay, that is not funny.

450
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:10,277
I am deducting <i>60</i> points from Voldemort

451
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,139
for false pretenses.

452
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,777
Okay, Dwight, your turn. Wow us.

453
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,585
The Aristocrats.

454
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:22,093
A man and his wife and children go
into the offices of a talent agency.

455
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:31,499
And the talent agent says,
"Describe your act."

456
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:36,333
And the man says something
really, really raunchy.

457
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,911
And the talent representative says,
"What do you call yourselves?"

458
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,413
And the man says, "The Aristocrats."

459
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,817
(EXCLAIMING)

460
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,023
DWIGHT: I mean, truly repulsive acts.

461
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,494
That is a very, very funny story.

462
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,288
Hey. I wanna say something.

463
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:06,129
I've been trying to be more honest lately,
and I just need to say a few things.

464
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,037
I did the coal walk. Just... I did it.

465
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:14,312
Michael, you couldn't even do that.
Maybe I should be your boss.

466
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,214
Wow, I feel really good right now.

467
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,209
Why didn't any of you come to my art show?

468
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,951
I invited all of you. That really sucked.

469
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:31,156
It's like sometimes some of you act
like I don't even exist.

470
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,696
Jim, I called off my wedding because of you.
And now we're not even friends.

471
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,770
And things are just, like, weird between us,
and that sucks.

472
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,600
And I miss you.

473
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,346
You were my best friend
before you went to Stamford.

474
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,874
And I really miss you.

475
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,279
I shouldn't have been with Roy.

476
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,915
And there were a lot of reasons
to call off my wedding.

477
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,688
But the truth is,
I didn't care about any of those reasons

478
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:03,750
until I met you.

479
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,155
And now you're with someone else.
And that's fine.

480
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,329
It's... Whatever. That's not what I'm...

481
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,934
I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt.

482
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,837
The thing that I'm just trying
to say to you, Jim,

483
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:21,270
and to everyone else in the circle,
I guess, is that I miss having fun with you.

484
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,675
Just you, not everyone in the circle.

485
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:32,250
Okay, I am gonna go walk in the water now.

486
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,285
Yeah. It's a good day.

487
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,860
<i>Pam!</i> That was <i>amazing!</i>

488
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,932

with a sales background.
