00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,000
W.B. Jones is renovating
their offices,

2
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:09,967
And their construction crews
are taking up

3
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,865
Some of the parking spaces
we used to get.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,800
So we had to park At a
satellite parking lot over there.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,300
Which just means we get
to see more Of our lovely street.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,650
Tell them what we saw today,
jim.

7
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:21,665
Oh, today we saw
a junkyard dog

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,200
Attacking the bones
of a rotisserie chicken.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,500
Nature.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,865
I've been here nine years,

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,100
and now all of a sudden I'm
supposed to park half a mile away.

12
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:32,500
I lost a penny
out of my loafers, oscar.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,400
I will quit.

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,400
As god is my witness,
i will quit If this is not fixed.

15
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:41,300
Some of us like the walk
more than others.

16
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:43,400

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>did you pick a new chair?</i>

22
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:10,965
It's been a while.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,700
Pam, when i first opened
this catalog,

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,600
I thought i was just going
to be picking out a chair.

25
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,537
But instead you found something
to distract you

26
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:20,269
from ever picking out a chair.

27
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:23,900
Michael started the process of selecting
a new chair About three weeks ago.

28
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:26,700
And normally i wouldn't care,
But he promised me his old one.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,050
It's way better.

30
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:29,300
It's one of these:

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
I really want it.

32
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,600
Have you ever seen
this woman?

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,765
Her?

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,300
The one in the really great
mesh, black, Hi-back swivel chair?

35
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:41,700
Look at her smile.

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,265
<i>it's eyes.
look at her eyes.</i>

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,500
She's got--
i don't know what it is exactly.

38
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,865
She dresses like
a professional,

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,100
And yet you know there is a side of
her That could just curl up on a couch.

40
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:56,067
Or in a great chair.

41
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:58,000
Uh, yeah, maybe, but...

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,665
Remember after my dinner party

43
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,000
When i said that
i was swearing off women?

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,165
I definitely remember
your dinner party.

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,500
i think what i meant Was that i am
completely swearing off one woman:

46
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,900
Jan.

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,700
I think that fate
put this catalog in my hands.

48
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,367
Actually, i put the catalog
in your hand

49
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:19,000
'Cause you have
to pick out a new chair.

50
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:21,000
What is it like being single?

51
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:22,465
I...like it.

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,700
I like starting each day
With a sense of possibility.

53
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,765
And i'm optimistic

54
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,100
Because every day
i get a little more desperate.

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,400
And desperate situations
yield the quickest results.

56
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:37,565
Ladies and gentlemen,

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,800
Would you please open your supply
catalogs And kindly turn to page 85?

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,300
<i>yo,</i>

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,465
Is this his new chair?

60
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,000
No, he hasn't picked one yet.

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,800
When pam gets michael's old chair,
I get pam's old chair.

62
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:56,400
Then i'll have two chairs.

63
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,100
Only one to go.

64
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,800
I am ready to start dating
again.

65
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,450
<i>getting back on the market.</i>

66
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:05,765
So fyi for those of you

67
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,700
Who were thinking about fixing me up
with any of your friends,

68
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:14,800
Use the woman on page 85
as a template.

69
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:16,300
That will be all.

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,300
I left my cell phone
in my car.

71
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,900
Call us when you get there
So we know you're okay.

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Listen, man,

73
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,850
I am completely over jan.

74
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,365
So...would you set me up?

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,700
If i had somebody
to set you up with, michael,

76
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:45,900
Then i'd take her
for myself.

77
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,100
- I thought you were engaged.
- Nope.

78
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:50,300
stacy broke up with me.

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,065
What?

80
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,700
God, that's terrible, man.

81
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,500
Augh, she's crazy.

82
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,500
Um, are you still on good terms
With any of her friends?

83
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:01,665
Not anymore.

84
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,600
It's a bigger situation.

85
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,100
Yeah--ugh!

86
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:06,500
She's--

87
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,300
you don't deserve her.

88
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
<i>all right.</i>

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,300
Oh, hello, oscar meyer
weiner lover.

90
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,800
I bet that you have A bunch of
very liberal girl-type friends

91
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,665
Who trust you implicitly

92
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
Because they know
you'd never touch 'em

93
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:25,400
Because of your condition.

94
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,900
<i>- michael.
- What?</i>

95
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,400
<i>- I have a friend who's single.
- oh.</i>

96
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:31,400
Sandy.

97
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,500
She's gorgeous and she's got
a feisty personality too.

98
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:36,900
Hmm, feisty.

99
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,400
So she's not jolly or sassy?

100
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Not like a jolly,
sassy opera singer?

101
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,600
No, she's a professional
softball player.

102
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,550
catcher or infield?

103
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't know,
michael.

104
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,800
Is she a dress-wearer
Or a pants-wearer?

105
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Could we share a rowboat?
Could a rowboat support her?

106
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,065
What are you asking?

107
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,465
I think i'm being very clear
what i'm asking.

108
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,800
Would an average-sized rowboat
support her Without capsizing?

109
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,200
It bothers me that you're
not answering the question.

110
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:12,567
No, all right?
No, she can't fit in a rowboat.

111
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:14,900
Damn it! i knew it!
I knew it, phyllis. okay.

112
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,265
What is wrong
with these people?

113
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,800
I would do anything for them,
And they're just hanging me out to dry.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Dating shouldn't be hard
for somebody like me

115
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:23,865
But it is,
and you know why?

116
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,500
Because nobody here
is willing to help me.

117
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,400
<i>nothing would ever get done
In this office</i>

118
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,500
without a formal request, would it?

119
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:34,665
Well fine, here goes.

120
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,650
<i>- i don't think that this is--
- now okay,</i>

121
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:38,600
I know that this
is probably not appropriate.

122
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,700
But i need help.

123
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,400
Because i want to play ball
with my kids Before i get too old.

124
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,500
<i>and before that happens,
I need to get laid.</i>

125
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,200
And before that happens,
i need to be in love.

126
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,500
and i don't want to hear
"i don't know, i can't help, na na na."

127
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:03,765
No, no, i am a catch,

128
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,300
And i am not going to be
the one who got away.

129
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,000
So this is what
we're going to do.

130
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,465
Dwight is going to hand out
index cards,

131
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,700
And i want you all to write
down the name Of an eligible woman

132
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:18,200
for me to date
By the end of the day.

133
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,600
No, by the end of the hour,

134
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:23,000
Or you are fired.

135
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,900
Write legibly, people.

136
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,402
Because of the construction
at W.B. Jones,

137
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:33,500
Half of us have to park
in the satellite lot.

138
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:34,500
<i>it's, like,
a 10 minute walk.</i>

139
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:35,465
No, 30.

140
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, look, i have an assigned
parking place in front, So...

141
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,665
all right, all right,
all right.

142
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,600
Um, let me try to think about
what it would be like To not have one.

143
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,100
Okay, yes.
that would be bad.

144
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:56,500
Yes. yes.

145
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:58,065
Okay, so...

146
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,600
- help us out.
- Wish i could, but i can't.

147
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:02,800
<i>well can,
But won't.</i>

148
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Should, maybe, but shorn't.

149
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,065
Michael, please--

150
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,800
What part of shorn't
don't you understand, kevin?

151
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:11,065
Look, i could probably
handle it, yes.

152
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,700
But i think it would be a good exercise
For you guys to do it yourselves.

153
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,900
- We won't let you down.
- Oh, you can't because i don't care.

154
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:20,100
<i>listen, don't forget
to fill out those cards.</i>

155
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
My love cards.

156
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,700
There's nobody i hate enough
To write her name on this card.

157
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, i'm setting michael up
with my fat friend anyway.

158
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:31,600
He can just deal with it.

159
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,300
- Who are you putting down?
- Oh, you don't know her.

160
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,300
- Who is it?
- Your mom.

161
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,100
Yeah, whatever.

162
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,300
Give that to me!
give that to--

163
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,000
"Hot and juicy redhead."

164
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,100
Let's give this a try.

165
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,400
<i>wendy's.</i>

166
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,565
Hello, wendy.

167
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
This is kevin's friend
michael.

168
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,800
<i>this isn't wendy.</i>

169
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,800
Oh, i'm sorry.
could you put her on, please?

170
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:07,300
<i>dude, this is a wendy's
restaurant.</i>

171
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,500
??God, kevin. Okay, um...

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,050
Could i just have a frosty
and a baked potato, please?

173
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:17,065

349
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,965
- It's happening.
- okay.

350
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,100
And when it happens, It's
going to kick your ass, beesly.

351
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,800
So...

352
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Stay sharp.

353
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
I've been warned.

354
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,400
I am not kidding.

355
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Got it a week
after we started dating.

356
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't know, man.

357
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,400
I was with jan
for so long.

358
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,100
I was excited
about meeting somebody new.

359
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,900
Put my heart out there.

360
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,600
You know what you need?

361
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,200
Closure.

362
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,300
You're right.

363
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,400
What do you mean though?

364
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
There was a woman in your life
Who affected you very deeply,

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,100
And she left
before you could say good-bye.

366
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,900
I think you need
to say good-bye.

367
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
Come on.
i'll drive.

368
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
- We did it!
- i did it.

369
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,200
We got our spaces back.

370
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,365
Nice job.

371
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
- Nice.
- yeah, there it is.

372
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,500
You're welcome.

373
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,065
Did i do this for me? No.

374
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,500
I did this
for the little guy.

375
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,365
For joe six-pack.

376
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
The guy who wakes up every morning
In his $400 a month apartment,

377
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:05,600
Wonders how he's gonna pay
his mortgage that month.

378
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Wonders how he's gonna fill
his car up with oil.

379
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,800
Wonders how am i going to pay
my kids' orphanage bills?

380
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:14,000
That guy...

381
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,600
Shouldn't have to wonder
where he's gonna park.

382
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,800
How did she die?

383
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,500
I guess you could say she died Of...

384
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,200
blunt force trauma and blood loss.

385
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,565
She got in a car accident

386
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
And ploughed into the side
of an airplane hangar.

387
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:50,200
- God.
- yeah.

388
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,100
She was so innocent.

389
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,700
She was stoned,
apparently.

390
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,665
You know,
i used to think That

391
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,100
i had this perfect person
out there waiting for me.

392
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:03,800
But now i know that that's
just silly.

393
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
Because she's dead.

394
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,900
What do you do?

395
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,900
You wait till next year's
chair catalogue comes out

396
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,100
And find someone
who's still alive.

397
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:17,800
- We move on.
- yeah.

398
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,800
Where do you want to go
for dinner?

399
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,900
I don't know. I kinda hate all
our regular places right now.

400
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,700
you know what,
that one...

401
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,400
Hey, pam.

402
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,600
Will you wait for me
one second While i tie my shoe?

403
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,765
<i>- I hate you.
- what?</i>

404
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,700
My shoe is untied.
what is your problem?

405
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,700
Oh, my god.
you thought i--

406
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,000
- No, no, no.
- how could i have thought that?

407
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:50,100
How could i
have thought that?

408
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,265
* bye-bye *

409
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,000

* but why'd you have to *
* go off and die? *

415
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,600
* why'd you have to *
* go off and die? *

416
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,000
* oh, you believe in rock and roll? *

417
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:36,200
* can music save your mortal soul? *

418
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,900
* and can you have to dance *

419
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:42,565
* real slow? *

420
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,800
