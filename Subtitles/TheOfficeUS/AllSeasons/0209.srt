1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:02,792
It is Friday morning

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:04,769
and it is another
beautiful day

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,773
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,439
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,974
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,050
We have
a serious problem here.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,353
All right everybody, lock the
doors, turn off the lights.

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,722
Pretend you're not here.

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,488
Are we in danger?

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,020
There's no time to think
about it, this is real.

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,896
Just... Everybody...

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,767
Michael,
should I call the...

13
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,503
What?

14
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:49,041
The IT tech guy and me did
not get off to a great start.

15
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,946
Yeah, I tried to
install it myself,

16
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:30,012
but you guys have these
things so password protected...

17
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,524
That just means you have
to enter your password.

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,428
What's your password,
Michael?

19
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:36,784
Uh...

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,954
That's...

21
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,430
1234?
Yes.

22
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,362
Michael...

23
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,371
Sorry.
Please don't do that.

24
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,911
Okay, I'm sorry.
What is going on in there?

25
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,573
Why is he here?
What are you doing?

26
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,115
I can't tell you.
You have to tell me.

27
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,175
I don't have to tell you
anything. Look, Michael,

28
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,084
I know you don't want to
have to think about this,

29
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,488
but if something were to
happen to you, God forbid,

30
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,492
then I would need to know
in order to take over.

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,289
Dwight, nothing is going
to happen to me, okay?

32
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,455
I'm in the best shape
of my life. Look at this.

33
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,723
Yeah, but that doesn't matter,
you could get a brain aneurysm...

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,233
I'm not going to get...
... or hit by a car...

35
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,791
Stop.
... or a bus or a train.

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,395
You could get poisoned, fall down
a well, step on a mine, choke.

37
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,336
I'm not... Okay, if I step on a mine
in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die,

38
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,035
you can have my job, okay?

39
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,737
Why don't you just go away?

40
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,680
There are certain things a boss
does not share with his employees.

41
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,616
His salary,
that would depress them.

42
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,285
His bed.

43
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,649
And I am not
going to tell them

44
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,751
that I'll be reading
their e-mails.

45
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,754
So how do you search?

46
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,525
By keyword phrase.

47
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,259
Try "profits. "

48
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,061
No, try "Michael Scott. "

49
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,803
"Michael," "boss"
and "funny. "

50
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,843
Oh, my God. Wow!

51
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,841
E- mail from Stanley.

52
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,475
Stanley, terribly nice guy.

53
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,109
"Sorry
I didn't write back sooner.

54
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,381
"I can't go to the game tonight
because my boss, Michael,

55
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,751
"is an ass
and making me stay late. "

56
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,154
Well, Stanley's an ass.

57
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,323
Not one of our harder workers.

58
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,194
Hey, what's the deal,
Michael?

59
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,064
Why are you spying
on our computers?

60
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,627
Oh, no! Everybody,
Oscar's gone crazy.

61
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,606
What other ghost stories
do you have for us?

62
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,072
That I'm a robot?

63
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,412
I will destroy
everything in my path.

64
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,675
Actually, we just...

65
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,541
Actually...

66
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:39,843
Okay.

67
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,416
Oil can.

68
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,385
Oil can.

69
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,618
Tin Man.

70
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,322
Actually, we just got
a memo from IT

71
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,296
saying you're doing
e- mail surveillance.

72
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,833
What? No, that defeats
the whole purpose.

73
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,028
So it's true? You have
access to our e-mails?

74
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,264
You know what the
problem is? I think I do.

75
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:03,138
The problem is that when people
hear the term "Big Brother,"

76
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,871
they immediately think
it's scary or bad.

77
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,244
But I don't. I think, "Wow,
I love my big brother. "

78
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,508
I gotta erase a lot of stuff.

79
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,048
A lot of stuff.

80
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,521
Oh, hey. Just so you know, if
you have any sensitive e-mails,

81
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,651
they need to be
deleted immediately.

82
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,355
I know.
Good.

83
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:27,831
Hey!

84
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,898
Something just happened.

85
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,304
Dwight just told Angela
that she has to delete

86
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,809
all of her sensitive e-mails
immediately.

87
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,606
What?
I know.

88
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,247
Do you think that they're, like... No.

89
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,806
Right. No, no.

90
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,380
Maybe.

91
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,718
It's like squishing a spider
under a book.

92
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,057
It's going to be really gross,
but I have to look

93
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,395
and make sure
that it's really dead.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,992
So if you guys
see anything...

95
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,235
Hey, Dwight?

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,466
My friend is kind of into these
two girls that he works with.

97
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,532
Nice.

98
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,545
One is tall and brunette,

99
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,810
and the other one
is short and blond

100
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,509
and perky
and kind of judgmental.

101
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,744
Who do you think
he should choose?

102
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,523
Does he have access
to their medical records?

103
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,548
Um...

104
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,857
I think one of the greatest
things about modern America

105
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,365
is the computerization
of medical records.

106
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,801
As a volunteer sheriff, I can look
up anyone's psychiatric records

107
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,531
or surgical histories.

108
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,763
Yeast infections.

109
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,005
There are a huge number of
yeast infections in this county.

110
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,771
Probably
because we're downriver

111
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,549
from that old bread factory.

112
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:58,413
Meredith has an evite
from Jim.

113
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,091
Barbeque at Jim's tonight.

114
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,821
Tonight?

115
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,125
Wonder where my evitation is.

116
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,359
Click on guest list.

117
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,028
Angela, Stanley,
Oscar, Meredith,

118
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,937
Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.

119
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,171
Must be...

120
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,270
No.

121
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,143
Hey, Angela. How's it going? Hey.

122
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,312
It's okay.

123
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,084
Listen, are you bringing
anyone to Jim's party tonight?

124
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,124
No. Are we supposed to?

125
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,623
No. I mean, I don't know.
I don't think so.

126
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,627
Excuse me.

127
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:55,113
There is always a distance
between a boss and the employees.

128
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,309
It is just nature's rule.

129
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,074
It's intimidation mostly.

130
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,747
It's the awareness
that they are not me.

131
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,451
I do think
that I'm very approachable

132
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,419
as one of the guys.

133
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,597
But maybe I need to be
even approachabler.

134
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,832
Are you going to eat with us?
Of course.

135
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,343
Hanging with my crew,
crew that I am one of.

136
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,442
Hanging with
my cup of noodles.

137
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,210
This is a meal in a cup.
Right here. Hot, tasty.

138
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,719
Reminds me of college.

139
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,255
Lived on this stuff.
Brain food.

140
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,824
You know what I really,
really miss about college?

141
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,224
The parties.

142
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,561
Everybody would go, the
athletes, the nerds, professors.

143
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,833
The professors
would go to the parties?

144
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,392
Yeah. They were the most fun.

145
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,066
We always invited them.

146
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,501
It's true,
I'm having a party.

147
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,378
I've got three cases
of imported beer,

148
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,512
karaoke machine
and I didn't invite Michael.

149
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,279
So, three ingredients
for a great party.

150
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,222
And it's nothing personal. I
just think that if he were there,

151
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,588
people wouldn't be able to
relax, you know, have fun.

152
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,025
And my roommate
wants to meet everybody.

153
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,025
Because, I'm pretty sure he
thinks I'm making Dwight up.

154
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,361
He is very real.

155
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,031
What?

156
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,441
Oh, yes!

157
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,741
Thank you.

158
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,951
Question.

159
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,219
On the Internet, there are
several different options

160
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,454
to get to your house
for the party tonight,

161
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,554
and I was wondering...
Could you keep that down?

162
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,558
Why?

163
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,692
Because not everybody knows
about the party.

164
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,094
Like who?
Who doesn't know?

165
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,263
Michael.

166
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,173
Why just Michael?

167
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,778
Because it's a surprise.

168
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,178
Is it?

169
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,847
Oh, that's perfect.

170
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,179
So don't tell.

171
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,775
I won't.
Okay.

172
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,487
So, Dwight thinks that tonight
is a surprise party for Michael.

173
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,453
Really? That's great.
I know.

174
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,619
Maybe we can get him to hide
and wait somewhere.

175
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,686
Oh, man.

176
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,023
Oh, you know, speaking of
which, I was just trying to get

177
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,933
a handle on numbers
for food and stuff,

178
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,868
so do you think
Roy's gonna come, or...

179
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,702
Oh, no, he can't make it.

180
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,207
Okay, cool.

181
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,674
Hey, there.
Hey.

182
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,881
Almost quitting time.

183
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,213
Yep, it's 4:00.

184
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,355
One more hour to take care
of anything you forgot to do.

185
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,928
Hey, you know, I don't know
if you have any plans tonight,

186
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,190
but if you don't,
we could hang out.

187
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,622
Oh, um...

188
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,326
I can't.

189
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,734
You have plans?
Yeah, I do.

190
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,102
Yeah? I do, too. I do, too.

191
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,266
You do?
Big plans. I do. Yeah.

192
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,502
Because you just said
you wanted...

193
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,476
Tonight?
I can't do it tonight, no.

194
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,570
Improv class.
I have improv class.

195
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,909
Hanging out
with my improv buds.

196
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,006
Really?
Yeah.

197
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,141
That sounds
like a lot of fun.

198
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,741
Oh, it's the best.
It is the best.

199
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,514
I would not miss it
for the world.

200
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,351
But if something else came up,
I would definitely not go.

201
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,790
Improv sounds great.

202
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,419
It is.

203
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,496
Okay.

204
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,661
All right.

205
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,427
What?

206
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,398
I think
Stanley just coughed.

207
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,915
Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk
you to your vehicular transport?

208
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,681
No, thanks.
All right.

209
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,789
Oscar, got big plans
tonight... I'm on a call.

210
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,156
Okay. Kevin. Big man, big man,
what are you doing tonight?

211
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,394
Where are you off to?
My brother is in town

212
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,454
and we are going to see
the Alaska Film Festival...

213
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,726
Okay, all right.

214
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,793
Hey, Angela. Rushie, rushie!
Where're you rushing off to?

215
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,929
I'm just leaving
for the day.

216
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,939
Yeah, well, duh!
Where're you headed?

217
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,234
Charity bake drive.

218
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,970
Liar! You are a liar.

219
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,137
No. No, I'm not!

220
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,881
Dwight! Oh, Dwight,
my loyal compadre.

221
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,416
You and I
are hanging tonight.

222
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,853
The two of us.
We are celebrating our freedom

223
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,355
and our manhood.

224
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,317
You know what?
Why don't we watch that show

225
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,487
that you've been wanting to watch?
That stupid Battleship Galaxy.

226
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,723
Battlestar Galactica.

227
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,925
That's... Whatever stupid show
you want to watch,

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,297
we're watching it.
I can't tonight.

229
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,269
Unfortunately, I've got plans.
I have to go to practice.

230
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,037
Soccer practice.

231
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,340
I didn't know
you played soccer, Dwight.

232
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,641
Clarinet.

233
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,904
You, too, Dwight?

234
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,444
Have fun tonight, whatever
it is that you're doing,

235
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,176
and I'll see you Monday.

236
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,615
He has no idea.

237
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,029
Quick announcement, everybody, if
I could have everybody's attention.

238
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,656
We do have wine in the kitchen

239
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,327
and there is beer
available on the porch.

240
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,831
And despite
what you might think

241
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,131
it's not all for
Meredith and Kelly.

242
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,105
So please enjoy.
Jim.

243
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,269
You really think
this is a good idea?

244
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,136
A hide-a-key rock?

245
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,844
Hey, you must be Dwight.

246
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,844
You don't work with us.

247
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,437
That's because
Mark's my roommate.

248
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,007
Hey, I love
the Birkenstocks.

249
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,073
Thanks.

250
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,684
Yeah, I always keep an extra set
in the car for special occasions.

251
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,213
Jim, come here.

252
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,222
When is the guest of honor
coming?

253
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,957
Oh, laterish.

254
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,223
He's gonna love it.
Great.

255
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,167
Just wanna let you guys know that we
will be taking the tour like I promised.

256
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,466
Hey.
Hey. Just in time.

257
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,639
Do you wanna go on the group
tour? We were just about to leave.

258
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,505
Definitely. Well, the group
tour is now leaving then.

259
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,176
Ladies and gentlemen,
just a few things

260
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,678
that we're going to be
pointing out to you today.

261
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,873
You will be able to see
both bedrooms

262
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,313
and if we're lucky,

263
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,749
maybe you get a chance to peek
into the bathroom, who knows?

264
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,788
I have to remind you also that
flash photography is prohibited

265
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,722
and as much as you can, please
refrain from touching things.

266
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,425
I know you might want to.

267
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,790
Hey, is Katie coming?

268
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,593
Actually, I haven't
talked to her in a while.

269
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,652
It's off?

270
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,228
Is it cool
if I call her?

271
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,664
We can talk
about that later.

272
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,193
Okay, let's get
right into it.

273
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,964
I need two people
for the first scene.

274
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,730
Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter!

275
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,908
Okay, Michael
and...

276
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,072
Anybody?

277
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,072
How about Mary-Beth?
Okay.

278
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,080
Come on.

279
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,048
Okay, so you start us off, Mary-Beth.

280
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,347
All right. Great. Okay.

281
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,053
Detective Michael Scarn!
I'm with the FBI!

282
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,695
Think about this. What
is the most exciting thing

283
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,824
that can happen on TV or
in movies or in real life?

284
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,531
Somebody has a gun.

285
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,504
That's why
I always start with a gun.

286
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,869
Because you can't top it.

287
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,567
You just can't.

288
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,633
I'm supposed to meet my
doctor here. Have you seen him?

289
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,110
He's a very angry midget.

290
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,647
Boom! Freeze!
Michael Scoon, FBI!

291
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,012
You know what you did.

292
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,621
Yeah, you thought you could get away
with your little ruse, didn't you?

293
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,678
Didn't you?

294
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:21,157
Well, you didn't, because I
know where you hid the diamonds.

295
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,525
I've been onto you and your
little friends for weeks.

296
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,826
Boom! Boom! Boom!

297
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,024
I'm not even in the scene!

298
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,361
Boom! Boom! Boom!

299
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,459
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Okay.

300
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,231
You shot me, okay, great.
Stop. Okay. What? Why?

301
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,272
You can't just shoot
everyone in the scene.

302
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,602
Well, if you hadn't stopped
the scene

303
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,164
you would have seen
where it was going.

304
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,403
Okay, what about the scene
they set up?

305
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,671
Boring.

306
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,111
No, it wasn't. No more guns.
It could've...

307
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,648
No, no, Michael.

308
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,278
Why don't you give me
all the guns you have?

309
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,453
Just get rid of all your guns
and give them to me.

310
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,016
Great.

311
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,650
Okay.

312
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,760
Jim's bedroom.

313
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,531
See, I knew we lost somebody
on the tour.

314
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,506
It's...
Cool.

315
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,543
This is your desk?
This is my desk.

316
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,941
Your home office?

317
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,070
Home office.

318
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,773
This is it.
Yeah.

319
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,645
You have to sit down,
so I can get the full effect.

320
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,082
Okay, sure. Will do.

321
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,046
Okay, wait.

322
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:27,149
So that would make me,
like, right here.

323
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,087
Yeah, yeah,
that feels about right.

324
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,221
And then,
Dwight would be, like...

325
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,289
You know what? Let's just
leave that image out of it,

326
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,594
because this is a happy place.

327
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,034
Happy thoughts, Pam,
happy thoughts.

328
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:41,971
Yearbook.

329
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,339
Yeah, you don't have to...
All right.

330
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,872
Yes, that's not going to be
awkward at all.

331
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,812
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.

332
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,215
You were so dorky.

333
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,253
Thank you.

334
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,661
Freeze.
I'm in.

335
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,163
Do you want to go over
the rules one more time?

336
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,528
No, no, no, no!

337
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,598
I'm looking in my wallet for money
so you can tell me my fortune.

338
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,473
I promise it's worth it.

339
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,778
I can see you
walking out of here

340
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,973
and you're thrilled
with your reading.

341
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,584
What are you...

342
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,257
Michael, what did you tell him? Nothing.

343
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,022
Then why are
his hands up?

344
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,560
Bill?

345
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,692
He told me he couldn't show
it to me, but he has a gun.

346
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,763
Okay, let's call it a day.
Nice job.

347
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,033
Good. That was good.

348
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,573
Good work, everybody!

349
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,700
Angela!

350
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,639
Burger? Dog? Having fun?

351
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,707
I got sap on me.

352
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,611
Chicken, hotdog, burger.

353
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,819
I'm a vegetarian.

354
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,311
There is soda inside.

355
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,525
I didn't think the premium laser color-copy
batch would sell as well as it did.

356
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,892
It surprised us all.
I'll tell you why, because...

357
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,864
I'm sorry, guys. Can we
please not talk about paper?

358
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,524
There's gotta be something
else that we could talk about.

359
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,267
I think it's all right.
I mean, Jesus drank wine.

360
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,244
Hey, Phyllis.
Come here for a second.

361
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,411
Sure.

362
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:39,648
Have you heard anything about
any secret office romances or...

363
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,884
You tell me.

364
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,426
You do mean
you and Jim, right?

365
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,833
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

366
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,369
I mean, I thought, you
guys hang out all the time,

367
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,736
and you're talking all the
time... And I'm sorry. I...

368
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,269
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

369
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,715
Not so fast, fire guy...

370
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,974
How do I get to Bernie's
Tavern from here?

371
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,043
Don't worry, we're all gonna
carpool. To Bernie's, huh?

372
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,315
We're all going to Bernie's?

373
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,857
Sorry, we're not going
as a group.

374
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,654
It's just a private friend

375
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,193
who happens to know all of us
from different ways,

376
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,525
is throwing a private birthday
thing. Right, right, right, right.

377
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,690
Well guys, I'd love to go to
Bernie's with you, but you know what?

378
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,200
I have an office party. Big
office party I need to go to.

379
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,566
Can't get out of it. Hey,
see you later. Good job.

380
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,128
Nice job, Bill. Not.

381
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,932
Here I go again on my own

382
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:37,008
Going down the only road
I've ever known

383
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,016
Oh, hey, how's your little
side project going?

384
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,687
Oh, yeah, I gave that up.
Really?

385
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,212
Yeah, it turns out I was
just grasping at straws.

386
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,717
Just because two people
are hanging out,

387
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,819
it doesn't mean
that they're together.

388
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,530
You know, like,
people can just be friends.

389
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,795
And I think that it
was really unfair of us

390
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,234
to assume that there was
anything else going on.

391
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,565
Just turn around now

392
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,735
'Cause you're not
welcome anymore

393
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,541
and I got all my...

394
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,047
Surprise!

395
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,978
Everybody!
Wow.

396
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,245
Who opened the morgue
for this thing?

397
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,050
I was just driving by,
I thought I'd drop in.

398
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,024
There's some wine. I would love a
glass, if you're going to open it.

399
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,788
Hello, temp,
take my jacket.

400
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,688
Oh, come on, that guy?

401
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,332
He is a good guy,
not a terrorist.

402
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,903
Karaoke, I love it.

403
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:36,099
I am a karaoke fiend.

404
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,502
I call dibs, I got next.
I got next up.

405
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,239
Come on,
let's get this party started!

406
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,776
Okay, where is that wine?

407
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,285
Okay, this is a duet, so,

408
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,584
I need somebody else. Pam, you
wanna come up and sing this one?

409
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,583
Need somebody else.
Takers, please.

410
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,532
Baby, when I met you
there was peace unknown

411
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,624
Kelly?

412
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,159
I tried to get you
with a fine-tooth comb

413
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,672
I was soft inside

414
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,071
There was something going on

415
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,705
This is the part,
it goes to the girl.

416
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,879
You do something to me
that I can't explain

417
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,455
Hold me closer
and I feel no pain

418
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,617
Every beat of my heart

419
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,457
We got something going on

420
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,297
Tender love is blind

421
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,026
It requires a dedication

422
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,503
All this love we feel

423
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,269
needs no conversation

424
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,743
Divided together

425
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,448
Making love with each other

426
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,149
We're making love!

427
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,618
Islands in the stream

428
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,780
that is what we are

429
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,086
No one in between

430
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,649
How can we be wrong

431
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,559
Sail away with me

432
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,797
Talk! Just talk!

433
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,059
I...
Shut up!

434
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,932
Funny story. The way
I got into improv was...

435
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,968
I got into improv... The story
about me getting into improv

436
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,133
was that I was walking down
the street,

437
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,871
and a race car pulls up,
and the guy says,

438
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,470
"Hey you're funny. You're the
funniest guy I've ever seen,

439
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,379
"or my name
is not Dale Earnhardt. "

440
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,949
And that was an improv.

441
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,455
The real way
was that I found a flier.
