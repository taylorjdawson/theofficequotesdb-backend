1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,025
PAM: (ON PHONE)
Well, I should go.

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,298
All right.
I'll tell everybody here
that you say hi.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,033
No, don't.
I'm mad at them.

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,506
(CHUCKLES) Why?
What happened?

5
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,544
Not one of them called
to congratulate me
on our engagement.

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,805
Ah!

7
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:16,838
That, they might be
off the hook for,
because I didn't tell them.

8
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,077
What? Why not?

9
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,121
(SOFTLY) I just didn't,
you know, want to deal.

10
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,917
Come on.
It won't be that bad.

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,084
Okay. You know what?
Here we go.

12
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,823
Everybody,
I just want to make
an announcement.

13
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:35,459
Pam and I are engaged.
(ON SPEAKER)
Hi, everyone!

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,696
I thought you were
already engaged.
Nope.

15
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,229
That was Roy.
She was engaged to Roy.
Thank you, Angela.

16
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:45,141
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.
Do I have to get another one?

17
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,337
Yes.

18
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,177
A little close to
my engagement there, Tuna.
What's your game here?

19
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,309
To get married.
She's not a virgin,
you know.

20
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,374
Wow!

21
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,542
What's going on?

22
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,715
No. Nothing.
Nothing, Michael.
Just saying hi.

23
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,850
The tall guy got engaged.

24
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,587
To be married?
Yep.

25
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:04,986
(GRUNTS)

26
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:06,758
Sorry.

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,888
Pencils down!
Just kidding.
Take your time.

28
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,483
HOLLY: Today is Ethics Day.

29
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,792
After they finish the quiz,
I'm going to run
my first meeting here.

30
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:44,201
It's going to be insane.
No, it's not. I have
to read from the binder.

31
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,140
I got it. I got it.

32
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,938
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

33
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,652
(BO TH SINGING)
Let's get ethical, ethical

34
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,525
I want to get ethical

35
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,656
Let's get into ethics, yeah

36
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,326
Let me hear
Dunder Mifflin talk

37
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,527
Your body talk

38
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,901
Let me hear your body talk

39
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,303
(WHOOPS) All right!

40
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:24,139
"Why are you helping her?
You're not even dating."
She's my friend.

41
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,077
And ultimately my strategy is

42
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,550
to sort of merge this
into a relationship

43
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,609
without her even knowing.

44
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:39,357
Okay! Let's give it up
for Miss Holly Flax!

45
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,517
HOLLY: Thanks, Michael.

46
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,618
(EXHALING)

47
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,856
Today we're going to have
a business ethics seminar

48
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,263
because recently,
without mentioning any names,

49
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,893
there has been some
misconduct at corporate

50
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:54,303
and we have a very strict
ethics policy and that
employee has been fired.

51
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,708
Come on. He's right there.
He was hired.

52
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,372
Check it out, hired guy.
Nice.

53
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:05,144
Okay, elephant in the room.
Let's talk about it.

54
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:09,382
Do I regret what I did?
Of course I do.

55
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,015
Even though it was
an amazing ride
and I'll give an example.

56
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:16,221
Anyone see Survivor,
Season Six? Anyone know
JoAnna on that show?

57
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:20,460
In New York City,
I hooked up with a girl
who looked exactly like that.

58
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,592
Indistinguishable. So...

59
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,064
Okay. Well done.
Good speech, Ryan.
You're a good guy.

60
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,076
Let's start discussing
those questionnaires that
you filled in this morning.

61
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,113
It is wrong to make
personal calls
during work hours.

62
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,047
Now, some of you marked
that you very strongly agree.

63
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,584
But ideally,
you would have selected
"totally agree."

64
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:44,282
I thought "very strongly
agree" sounded stronger
than "totally agree."

65
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,825
Corporate would like
to emphasize that ideally

66
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,225
you would all totally agree
with that statement.

67
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:53,664
Well, I think we can
all totally agree that
Holly is totally fantastic.

68
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,032
(MICHAEL CLAPPING)
Thank you.
Okay. Okay.

69
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,867
In fact, spending a half hour
at the water cooler
during work hours

70
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,407
is a form of stealing.

71
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,533
What?
HOLLY: Yes.

72
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,307
It's called "time theft"
and it's the same as taking
money from the company.

73
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,316
Can anyone think of examples
of things that are
over-the-line time wasters?

74
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,578
This meeting.

75
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,779
(MEN CHEERING)
Can't set them up like that.

76
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,652
Why is it okay for smokers
to take breaks all the time?

77
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,421
If I want to go outside and
hang out once an hour, then
I'll just take up smoking.

78
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,257
I'll do it. I don't care.
MEREDITH:
I'll smoke with you.

79
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,819
I got a bag of cigars
in my purse.

80
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,627
Stealing office supplies
is another big ethical area

81
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,032
that there seems to be
some confusion about.

82
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,162
Okay. Could we have
a moment?

83
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,432
(WHISPERING)
Can I talk to you
for a second?

84
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,530
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

85
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,940
A lot of good stuff.
And you look...
You look fantastic.

86
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,808
Michael.
Yeah?

87
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,904
What should we be working on
while you guys are talking?

88
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,778
Do some...
Do some work.

89
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,352
(WHISPERING)
People expect a lot
from these meetings.

90
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,117
Laughter, sudden twists,
surprise endings,

91
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,490
you need to be Robin Williams
and M. Night Shyamalan.

92
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,085
You need to be
Robin Shyamalan.

93
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,721
(WHISPERING) Well,
I just have to get
through the binder.

94
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,459
You're... It's just,
you're kind of losing them.

95
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,557
I am?
Yeah.

96
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,603
Don't think about the stakes.
It'll freak you out.

97
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,439
Okay. Well,
Michael makes
a really good point.

98
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,102
So, let's just open
this up a little bit.

99
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:16,114
Say my name is Lauren
and here I am shopping
in a supermarket

100
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,275
and I steal a pencil.

101
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:22,253
That's not right.
(COUGHING) Lauren!
Enough with the pencils!

102
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,483
No. I have to
go over pencils
and office supplies.

103
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,754
It's part of
the ethics thing.
That isn't ethics.

104
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,593
Ethics is a real discussion
of competing conceptions
of the good.

105
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,462
This is just the corporate
anti-shoplifting rules.

106
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:39,096
I'll drop an ethics bomb
on you. Would you steal
bread to feed your family?

107
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,563
Boom!

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,440
Exactly, Andy.
Yeah. I took Intro
to Philosophy twice.

109
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,637
No big deal.
It's a trick question.

110
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,841
The bread is poisoned.
Also, it's not
your real family.

111
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,783
You've been cuckolded
by a stronger, smarter male.

112
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,979
No, that's not
how it works.

113
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:03,156
I would not steal the bread.
And I would not let
my family go hungry.

114
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,720
HOLLY: Okay.
But we should get
back to business.

115
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:09,791
Have any of you
ever faced any ethical
dilemmas in the workplace?

116
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,430
MICHAEL: Anybody?

117
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,032
This is a chance
for you to say something
without any repercussions.

118
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,545
Stanley?
Oscar, come on.
I'll pass.

119
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,443
I will go first.

120
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,950
When I discovered YouTube,
I didn't work for five days.

121
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,212
I did nothing.

122
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:31,746
I viewed Cookie Monster
Sings Chocolate Rain
about 1,000 times.

123
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,453
What was the dilemma?
To tell you or not.

124
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,828
And I'm glad I did.
I feel very, very good.
Cathartic.

125
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,527
I promise you that
you are not going
to get into trouble.

126
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:46,538
You can say anything
you want with total
and complete immunity.

127
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,133
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah. Come on.
Anybody. Let it fly.

128
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,201
Okay. Once in a while,
I'll take a long lunch.

129
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,476
A siesta.
Time thief.
Time thief. Fire him!

130
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,280
Dwight, you've really never
stolen any company time?

131
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:05,188
Never.
You are a thief of joy.
Anybody else? Yeah?

132
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,250
Sometimes I download
pirated music onto
my work computer.

133
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,955
Who hasn't? Good.
Good. What else?

134
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,827
No, I'd like to hear
more about that.

135
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:18,599
I once reported Oscar to
the INS. Turns out he's clean,
but I'm glad I did it.

136
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,904
Well, let's keep
this party moving on.

137
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,236
I'll go.

138
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,642
Have you guys ever met
Bruce Myers, the Scranton
rep for Hammermill?

139
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,202
Bruce.

140
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,772
Well, for the past six years
I have been sleeping with him

141
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,913
in exchange for discounts
on our supplies and Outback
Steakhouse gift certificates.

142
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,216
Jackpot.

143
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,155
(LAUGHS)

144
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,955
(CLEARS THROAT)
Meredith, that is serious.

145
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,430
I mean, not only is that
a conflict of interest,

146
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,693
but there's also
an exchange of goods.

147
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,294
Exchange of steak.
Have you ever had
sirloin steak, honey?

148
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,533
That's crazy.
That's crazy talk.

149
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:59,237
Meredith, "the Merenator,"
sleeping with suppliers.

150
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,909
(LAUGHS)

151
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,972
Wow!

152
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,209
What time we got?

153
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,513
You know what?
That's a good place
to end it.

154
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,283
Right there.
This, I think, was
a great ethics seminar.

155
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,689
She has given us
a lot of wonderful
things to think about.

156
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,220
Right. What is wrong?
Who's to say, really,
in the end?

157
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:23,257
I mean, because it is
unknowable. But let's
give her a round of applause.

158
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,601
Holly, everybody! Holly!
Get back to work.

159
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,602
Great job.
I am truly impressed.

160
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,305
That... You really
pulled that one out.

161
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,814
Classic. Classic meeting.
We should celebrate.

162
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,444
Michael, there's
some serious issues
with Meredith.

163
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,114
I mean, all of you
have done things
I wouldn't have done myself,

164
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,714
but Meredith's actions
are really over the line.

165
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,259
Yeah. What are you
going to do?

166
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:59,968
So regarding this supplier,
approximately how many
liaisons have there been?

167
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,136
Liaisons? You mean
meet-ups? I don't know.
Once a month for six years.

168
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,269
Something like that.

169
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:10,475
Meredith, why don't you
tell Holly it's not
what she thinks,

170
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,284
nothing unethical happened
and that you just like
to sleep around?

171
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,517
Am I in trouble here
or something?

172
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,185
No. No. This is just
a stupid formality.

173
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,195
No, it's not a formality.

174
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:30,532
Now, were these
"meet-ups" just personal,
unrelated to business?

175
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,834
No. I wouldn't have
done it if it wasrt
for the discount paper.

176
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,567
There's not
a lot of fruit
in those looms.

177
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,304
(EXCLAIMS) For the love
of God, we're trying to
help you, you stupid bag.

178
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:44,247
What I don't understand is,
why the steak coupons?

179
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,514
I mean, if you were
already getting
the discounted paper...

180
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:52,684
Well, it's funny,
maybe it's a girl thing,
but after we did it,

181
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,888
when he would give me
those coupons, I just
felt good about myself.

182
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,966
Hey, what's going on here?
I thought I had immunity.

183
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,870
Well, unfortunately,
immunity or something
being off the record

184
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,204
does not really exist
in the workplace.

185
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,973
I mean, I've never heard
of anyone who kept their job
after something like this.

186
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,173
Well, I'm not quitting.

187

(STOP WATCH BEEPS)

190
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:33,491
Yawn, four seconds.
What are you doing?

191
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,194
You had said that you don't
do anything personal
during work time,

192
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,532
so I'm just making sure.

193
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,199
Wait a minute. So you're
going to time me every time
I yawn? That's absurd.

194
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,201
Really?

195
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,803
Hey, look, monkey knows
how to use a stop watch,
everybody.

196
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,074

Personal conversation.
17 seconds.

199
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,223

There is no way
that that was...

you're at your desk.

It's Mike-raculous.
(LAUGHS) Reaching.
You'll get there.

204
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:23,013
Anyway, I was giving it
some thought, and there's
no reason that two attractive,

205
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:29,817
good looking,
intelligent, funny,
attractive people can't,

206
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,983
you know, just sit down
and work this whole
Meredith thing out.

207
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,152
Sounds good.
Good.

208
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,323
Would you care to
bang it out over lunch?
I already bought this.

209
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,031
No, no, no.
Your food is no good
here, my lady.

210
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,435
Sorry.

211
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,340
You know what?
Let's go out.
Dunder Mifflirs treat.

212
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,975
Actually,
you're not a client,
so we'll just split it?

213
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,447
Ethical.

214
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,617
So, I've gone over
corporate policy.

215
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,753
What do you think?
What do you think
of this place?

216
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,320
It's very nice.
Isn't it?

217
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,926
Yeah. It's kind of
business romantic.
So you're from Des Moines.

218
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,335
Mmm.
That sounds so warm.

219
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,632
In summer.

220
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,769
Here, too.
You know what
my favorite season is?

221
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,541
Maybe we should talk
about Meredith first.

222
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,707
Yes. Get the boring stuff
out of the way.

223
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,549
Autumn was what I was
going to say. When the
leaves change, it's just...

224
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,488
I think it's the most
contemplative of seasons.

225
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:43,120
Okay, so I've gone over this
and I've thought about it
and I just don't think

226
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:47,256
there's any way I can write
a report that doesn't end
with her being terminated.

227
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:53,635
Terminate her. Terminator.

228
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,299
Yeah.

229
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,043
Hey, Andy.
Yo.

230
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,773
By any chance, did you
see Battlestar Galactica
last night?

231
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,372
No, I did not.
Was that any good?

232
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,441
Actually not.
It was really so-so.

233
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,611
Okay.

234
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,414
I mean, I like
all the crazy monsters
and stuff, you know,

235
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,722
like Klingons and Wookiees
and all that, but...

236
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,258
Sorry, was there something
you wanted to add, Dwight?

237
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,431
Is that anything
like the original
Battlestar Galactica?

238
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:29,235
You know what's weird?
It's practically
a shot-for-shot remake.

239
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,570
Really?

240
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,305
That's cool.
The story's kind of bland.

241
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,747
It's about this guy named
Dumbledore Calrissian...

242
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,182
Okay.
...who needs to return
the ring back to Mordor.

243
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,241
(HUFFING)

244
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,118
Really.
That doesn't sound right.

245
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:51,719
I just don't want my employees
thinking that their jobs
depend on performance.

246
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,790
I mean, what sort of place
is that to call home?

247
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,861
And Meredith needs
this job. This is
her main source of money.

248
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,932
Well, that's
very sweet, but we have
to follow the protocol.

249
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,410
Those are the rules.
Okay, new idea.
We don't report it at all.

250
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,572
We just punish her.
We punish her?

251
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,446
Tell her,
"Can't have sex
for six months."

252
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,281
I don't think
we could enforce that.

253
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,948
I don't know.
I saw this thing.
Like a belt with a key.

254
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,285
A chastity belt.

255
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:25,786
No, it's more of an underwear
garment that has little
spikes, like, made of...

256
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,993
Like sometimes they're
made of metal. You know
what I'm talking about?

257
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,969
You unlock
a little door that...

258
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:37,031
Down where you...
Where you put...
Where you put the...

259
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,183
He has not stopped
working for a second.

260
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,848
At 12:45, he sneezed
while keeping his eyes open,

261
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,252
which I always thought
was impossible.

262
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,921
At 1:32, he peed.

263
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:03,094
And I know that because
he did it in an open
soda bottle under the desk

264
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,136
while filling out
expense reports.

265
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,228
And on the flip side,

266
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:10,071
I've been so busy
watching him that
I haven't even started work.

267
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,736
It's exhausting,
being this vigilant.

268
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,837
I'll probably have
to go home early today.

269
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:21,712
I am just saying that
I don't think that you
understand what I am saying.

270
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:25,484
No, you are saying
that we should sweep
it under the carpet,

271
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,958
accept the discount
on supplies, not fire Meredith

272
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,054
and pretend like the whole
thing never happened.

273
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,632
Yes.
What am I saying?

274
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,792
Well...

275
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,566
(LAUGHS) Busted. I don't...

276
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,198
I'm saying that
her behavior is unethical,
and a little icky.

277
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,299
And I don't think I want
to work in an environment

278
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,537
where that sort
of conduct is tolerated.

279
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,080
Well, you have
to tolerate a lot when
you're part of a family.

280
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,673
It's not a family.
It's a workplace.

281
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:09,726
I will be honest with you.
That car ride did not go well.

282
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,861
And that was not my fault.

283
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,167
The only reason
I am standing
out here right now

284
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,675
is because
I don't want to take
the elevator with her.

285
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,802
And I am holding
on to her leftovers.

So I guess I can assume
that was personal.

Fine.

292
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:59,907
So maybe you're not
completely ethical after all.

293
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,313
Yes. Maybe I'm not.

00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,300
It's been a little tense.

People are suspicious of me
and my best friend in the
office won't even talk to me.

Turns out being
the morality police
does not make you popular.

297
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,582
I should know,
because in middle school
I was the hall monitor

298
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:42,115
and the kids used to stuff
egg salad in my locker.

299

middle school was over.

00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,484
I just got the report
that your branch submitted.

308
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,651
And there's a lot of
stuff about a relationship
Meredith's having with a...

309
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,853
Yes, that came out during
the ethics seminar...

310
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,626
And let the record show
that it was during the
immunity part of the seminar.

311
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,600
Well, I'm not sure
these circumstances
warrant any action.

312
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,864
I think
it's pretty clear
it was unethical.

313
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,668
Well, from what I can gather,
it seems like a gray area.

314
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,436
Look, to be honest,
the company's getting
a discount at a tough time

315
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,741
in our balance sheet and
I don't know that the right
thing to do for the company

316
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,804
is to turn our
noses up at that.

317
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,976
Kendall, I understand
that the discount is
good for the company,

318
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,488
but I'm just not happy about
the way we're getting it.

319
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,689
(SIGHS) You see, I thought
I was clear with you, Holly.

completed the training.

Because every other branch
has managed to get this to us,

00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,459
so if it's not something
you can handle, then
that's a different discussion.

325
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,004
No. No, I can do it.
Good.

326
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,733
(DIAL TONE BEEPS)

327
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:11,143
How do you tell somebody
that you care about deeply,
"I told you so"?

328
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,876
Gently, with a rose?

329
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,857
In a funny way?
Like it's a hilarious joke?

330
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,353
Or do you just let it go?

331
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,058
Because saying it would
just make things worse.

332
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,236
Probably the funny way.

333
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,037
Can I have
everyone's attention?

334
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,738
Excuse me.
May I have everyone's
attention, please?

335
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,837
We need to finish
the ethics seminar.

336
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,008
No way, lady.
It's a trap.

337
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,278
Everyone, please,
I just need
your signatures

338
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,047
to show corporate
that I gave you
the training.

339
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,453
Don't sign anything.
Okay, everybody,
listen up,

340
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,787
if you're not in
that conference room
in two minutes,

341
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,258
I am going to kill you.

342
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,296
It's a quarter to 5:00
and I have started
to gather my things.

343
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,163
Get in there right now
or I'm going to lose it!

344
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,305
(WHISPERING)
Am I getting fired?

345
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,813
Now is really not
the time, Meredith.

346
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,277
In this next section
we examine the difference

347
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,185
between sick days
and personal days.

348
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,656
Sick days are only
to be used when
an illness precludes you

349
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,889
from doing your job
or can spread
to your co-workers.

350
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,330
Personal days,
on the other hand,
are much more flexible.

351
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,429
Thank you, Meredith,
this was delicious.
Hey, where's the steak sauce?

352
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,933
I think we're out.
I got some
in my minivan somewhere.

353
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,912
Wait a second,
how does this steak
factor in again?

354
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:54,646
I think she got it as a tip,
but I don't know why
she didn't just take cash.

355
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,245
I don't care what
she's doing, I hope
she just keeps doing it.

356
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,654
(CHUCKLING)
Amen. Just keep
the ribs coming.
