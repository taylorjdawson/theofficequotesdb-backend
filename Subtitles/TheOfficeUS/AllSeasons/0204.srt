1
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:07,031
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,009
Sure, can I ask who's calling?

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,602
Just a second.

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,044
Jim Halpert. What?
How did you get this number?

5
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:21,711
Stalker.

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,279
Katy and Jim
met in the office.

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,384
And now, I guess they're, like,
going out or dating or something.

8
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,621
And...

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,829
I don't know, you know.
They're just...

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,460
She calls him, and they...
You know.

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,699
I'm sorry, I feel like I'm talking
really loud. Am I talking really loud?

12
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,037
So we're still on for lunch?
You're meeting me here?

13
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,736
Okay. Great. Bye.

14
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,946
Hey, you can just
give her your extension.

15
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,745
Okay.

16
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,913
HowardlRyan.

17
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,478
Ryan Howard is sitting
in my office.

18
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,957
And he has been a temp here
for a couple of months,

19
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:37,019
and he's kind of gotten the
lay of the land a little bit.

20
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,559
Had a few laughs
along the way.

21
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,963
And now he wants
to know what I think.

22
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,896
The temp agency wants to know
what you think.

23
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,239
Shall we? Let us proceed.

24
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,575
First up, "Proficiency
in necessary skills.

25
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,180
"Excellent. "

26
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,790
Michael's in there right
now evaluating the temp.

27
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,458
He hasn't evaluated me
in years.

28
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,824
Five years from now,
what do you wanna do?

29
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,387
Where do you wanna be?

30
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,989
Well, I'm interested
in business.

31
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,365
Oh. Good. Ambitious.
Excellent.

32
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,332
Wanna be a manager?

33
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,574
No, actually, what I want
is to own my own company.

34
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,041
That is ridiculous.

35
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:29,110
Ryan's about to attend the
Michael Scott School of Business.

36
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,546
I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda
rolled into one.

37
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,718
"Much advice you seek. "

38
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,184
Do you know who that is?

39
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,122
Fozzie Bear?

40
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,952
Hmm.

41
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,829
No. That was Yoda.

42
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,800
There are 10 rules of business
that you need to learn.

43
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,339
Number one:

44
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,643
You need to play to win,

45
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:02,044
but you also have to

46
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,875
win to play.

47
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,412
Got it.

48
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,684
And I will give you
the rest of the 10 at lunch.

49
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:15,952
Hey.

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,064
Michael and I have
a very special connection.

51
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,127
He's like Batman,
I'm like Robin.

52
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,833
He's like the Lone Ranger
and I'm like Tonto.

53
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,809
And it's not like there was the
Lone Ranger and Tonto and Bonto.

54
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,080
People!

55
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,181
Okay, everybody!

56
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,055
This is not a test.
Move to the exits.

57
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,753
Devon, head towards
the exit. Do not panic!

58
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,887
Get up off your desks. No, I
don't wanna hear it. All right?

59
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,158
Let's go, people!
No panic is warranted.

60
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,631
Do not panic!
Go in a single-file line.

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,327
This is not a drill!

62
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,663
Arms at your side!
Arms at your side!

63
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,569
Please, move quickly! This
is a paper company, people.

64
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,076
Step lively. This whole place is
a tinderbox. It is ready to blow.

65
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,638
This is not a test.
Can you leave?

66
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,841
Oh, you say that every time.

67
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,383
Do you wanna die?

68
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,475
Oh, God.

69
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,019
Do you wanna die? Out!

70
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,315
All right, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

71
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,686
Stanley, have you ever seen a
burn victim? Move to the exits.

72
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,691
Come on, your safety partners.
Your safety partners. Let's go!

73
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,193
Real smoke!
We've got smoke! Smoke!

74
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,256
God!

75
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,941
Oh, Kelly! Are you okay?
I got you!

76
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,070
I'm okay!

77
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,613
Cover your nose and mouth.
Hey, let go of me!

78
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,012
Breathe through your nose.
Let go of me!

79
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,176
Breathe through your nose.
Remove your stockings, okay?

80
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,085
They'll melt right into your
flesh. Stay below the smoke line.

81
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,826
Let's go! Clear out, stat!
Stat means now!

82
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,956
Yes,
I was the first one out.

83
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,901
And, yes, I've heard women
and children first,

84
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,200
but we do not employ children.

85
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,241
We are not a sweatshop,
thankfully.

86
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,837
And women are equal
in the workplace by law.

87
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,578
So, I let them out first,
I've a lawsuit on my hands.

88
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,151
Another rule of business is being
able to adapt to different situations.

89
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,247
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

90
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,091
Adapt. React. Readapt.

91
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,296
Apt. All right?
That's rule number two.

92
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,424
Okay, guys, listen up.
We need a head count.

93
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,161
Okay, we need to count off.
Michael's number one.

94
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,293
Where is he? Where's he?

95
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,462
So, what was rule two?

96
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,529
Adapt, react, readapt, apt.

97
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,336
Okay, well, let's just kind
of take it a little slower.

98
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,741
Hey, Michael, Ryan needs
a number for the count off.

99
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,303
Okay, well, "1" is taken.

100
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,814
Okay, "2"?
No!

101
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,577
Oh, sorry.
Okay.

102
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,175
He can have "14."
Marjorie's not here today.

103
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,844
Well, he needs
a permanent number, right?

104
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:55,979
No, I don't.

105
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,649
Oh, you know what else? I thought
of a nickname for the three of us.

106
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,090
Three Musketeers.

107
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,790
Yeah, okay. Yeah. No, no, no.
I got one, I got one.

108
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,091
The Three Stooges.

109
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,359
That's funny, too. But if
we're the Three Musketeers...

110
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,459
I don't wanna be, like,
a guy here, you know?

111
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,172
Like, Stanley
is the crossword-puzzle guy

112
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,365
and Angela has cats.

113
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,910
I don't wanna
have a thing here.

114
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,976
You know, I don't wanna be
the "something guy. "

115
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,807
Okay, you know what?

116
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,581
I think I'm gonna be
setting the agenda here, okay?

117
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,315
Can everybody gather up,
please?

118
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,654
Important announcement.
Very important announcement.

119
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,821
I think this is a perfect opportunity
for all of us to participate

120
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,957
in some really intense,
psychologically revealing conversations.

121
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,365
So, we're gonna be playing
"desert island,"

122
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,460
um...

123
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,903
"Who would you do" and...

124
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,601
"Would you rather. "
"Would you rather. "

125
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,074
"Would you rather"
is our third game.

126
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,110
Yeah!

127
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,822
Hey, guys.
Great response time.

128
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,456
Listen up. I got some
theories. Okay, there's a...

129
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,188
Okay, so three books
on a desert island, Angela.

130
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,098
The Bible.

131
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,232
That's one book.
You've got two others.

132
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,233
A Purpose Driven Life.

133
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,469
Nice.

134
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,534
Third book.

135
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,601
No.

136
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,206
Okay, Phyllis.

137
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,713
The Da Vinci Code.

138
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,309
I would take
The Da Vinci Code,

139
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,820
so I could burn
The Da Vinci Code.

140
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,187
Okay, great. That's gonna keep
you warm for, like, seven seconds.

141
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,783
Question, is there
firewood on the island?

142
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,021
I guess.

143
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,290
Then I would bring an axe,
no books.

144
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,956
No, it has
to be a book, Dwight.

145
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,491
Fine.

146
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,229
Physician's Desk Reference.

147
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,327
Nice. Smart.

148
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,431
Hollowed out. Inside, water
proof matches, iodine tablets,

149
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,810
beet seeds, protein bars,
NASA blanket,

150
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,473
and, in case I get bored,

151
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,808
Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone.

152
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,250
No, Harry Potter
and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

153
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,312
Question, did my shoes
come off in the plane crash?

154
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,792
Rule number four: In
business image is everything.

155
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,328
Andre Agassi.

156
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,889
This car is an investment,
right?

157
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:23,368
If I have to take out a client or
I'm seen around Scranton in it...

158
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,964
I love it. I love this car.

159
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,100
Do you like it?

160
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,572
Yeah.

161
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,172
Okay, thought
people read more books.

162
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,015
DVDs. Five movies, what
would you bring to the island?

163
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,111
Yes, Meredith.

164
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,249
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat
Greek Wedding, Legally Blonde,

165
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,724
Bridges of Madison County.

166
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,782
Wow.

167
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,525
Legends of the Fall.

168
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,291
Wow.
Bridges of Madison County.

169
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,798
Legally Blonde.
These movies are just...

170
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,890
Well, I kind of like
Legally...

171
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,562
Wait, wait, wait.
Pam, no. Do you understand?

172
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:03,166
The game is "desert island movies,"
not "guilty pleasure movies. "

173
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:07,008
Desert island movies are the movies you're
gonna watch for the rest of your life.

174
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,570
Forever. Unforgivable.

175
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,014
I take it back.
Unforgivable.

176
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,516
I take it back.
Good.

177
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,119
And, Ghost.
But just that one scene.

178
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,252
Is this your car, Ryan?

179
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,954
Well, sir, I don't... Some
pretty big books back there.

180
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,018
Good shocks.

181
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,859
Hello, Mr. Egghead.

182
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,133
Oh, Stanley Kaplan.
I know him.

183
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,431
"M" is for Murder,
"P" is for...

184
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,369
That's actually a test-prep
book.... for Phone. What?

185
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,168
That's a test-prep
for business school.

186
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,837
Oh, thinking about
business school?

187
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,843
I just got in.
I applied. I go at night.

188
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,880
Really? So, you think you
know a lot about business?

189
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,745
No, not yet. Just started.

190
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,805
Uh-huh. Yeah.

191
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,582
Quiz me.

192
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,983
I wouldn't even
know where to start.

193
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,487
Oh, come on. Come on,
egghead, let's do it.

194
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,579
Do it.

195
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,748
Quiz me up.

196
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,813
All right.

197
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:58,119
Why have people been rethinking the
Microsoft model in the past few years?

198
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,534
When I was Ryan's age,

199
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,335
I worked in a fast food restaurant
to save up money for school.

200
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,466
And then I lost it
in a pyramid scheme,

201
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:17,107
but I learned more about
business right then and there

202
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,311
than business school would ever
teach me or Ryan would ever teach me.

203
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,686
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer
or to keep an existing customer?

204
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,182
Keep an existing cust...
Shut it.

205
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,284
Can I just do it, please?

206
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,994
It's equal.

207
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,097
It is 10 times more expensive
to sign a new customer.

208
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,498
Okay. Yes,
it was a trick question, okay.

209
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,332
Look, I mean, he didn't need
business school, okay?

210
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,666
Michael comes from the school
of hard knocks.

211
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,899
All right. Okay, Dwight...
Self-taught.

212
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,133
You didn't even go to college.

213
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,642
You know what? You don't
need to help me here, okay?

214
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,372
You know, maybe you should go
to business school like Ryan.

215
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,277
Then you'd know
what you're talking about.

216
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,372
Come on.
So...

217
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,643
I'm studying with the master.

218
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,809
Reference. Why don't
you go to business...

219
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,284
You should learn from him,
right? Right? Right?

220
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:58,221
Stop it, Dwight. You know what,
Dwight? You're acting like a dork.

221
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,918
Would you cool it,
please? Okay.

222
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,363
Hey, he's not your
five-year-old brother, Dwight.

223
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,921
He's a valued member
of this company.

224
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,298
And you know what? He knows more
about business than you ever will.

225
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,868
Stupid.

226
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,430
I did not
go to business school.

227
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,204
You know who else didn't go
to business school?

228
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,542
Lebron James, Tracy McGrady,
Kobe Bryant.

229
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,539
They went right from high
school to the NBA, so...

230
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,521
So, it's not the same thing
at all.

231
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,659
Look at this stuff. "Market fragments.
" What is that supposed to be?

232
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,425
It's a way of looking at consumers
as subsets of a larger client base.

233
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,158
You are so smart.
You are so effing smart.

234
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,965
You should be teaching me.

235
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,941
Pam, get us back into it.

236
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,601
Okay.
Five movies. Go ahead.

237
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:55,943
Fargo, Edward Scissorhands,
Dazed and Confused.

238
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,482
Oh, definitely in my top five.

239
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,677
Yes, in my top three,
so suck it.

240
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,046
Breakfast Club.
What?

241
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,885
The Princess Bride and...
Okay, that's five.

242
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,015
No, my all-time favorite!

243
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,320
Pam, play by the rules.

244
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,985
All-time favorite!
Play by the rules.

245
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,394
Dwight,
all-time favorite movie.

246
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,565
The Crow.

247
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,231
I became a salesman

248
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,639
because of people.
I love making friends.

249
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,710
But then I was promoted
to manager, very young age.

250
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,282
I still try to be
a friend first,

251
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,889
but, you know,
when you're very successful,

252
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,291
your co-workers
look at you differently.

253
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,928
What do you think?

254
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,706
Maybe we should get some air.
No, I'm okay.

255
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,005
I'm really uncomfortable.

256
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,905
All right. Let's move on.

257
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,712
Let's move on to the main
event, "Who would you do?"

258
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,275
Present company excluded?

259
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,377
Not necessarily.

260
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,046
Pam.
Pam.

261
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,281
Um...

262
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,959
Okay. You know what? Maybe I'll
finish explaining the rules.

263
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,292
Let me explain it first
and then...

264
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,164
Yeah, so we'll get right... You
know what? I'll be right back.

265
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,206
Stanley, you're taking over for
me, buddy. I'll be right back.

266
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,366
Okay.

267
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,704
Dwight.

268
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,642
Dwight!

269
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,649
Come one, Dwight, use words.

270
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,954
Why didn't I
go to business school?

271
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,080
Who goes to business school?

272
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,418
The temp.
He does?

273
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,891
Yeah, it's all him and Michael
talk about anymore.

274
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,225
You know, I bet
Ryan thinks to himself,

275
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,323
"I wish I were a volunteer
sheriff on the weekend. "

276
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,731
He doesn't even know
that I do that.

277
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,291
You should tell him.

278
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,669
Oh, yeah, Pam, right. That's gonna
help things. Just talk it out.

279
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,766
I hope the war goes on forever
and Ryan gets drafted.

280
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,868
Dwight.
What?

281
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,209
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't...

282
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,305
Just part of me meant it.

283
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,149
Besides, he'd end up
being a hero anyway.

284
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,788
You know what you should do?

285
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,346
You should quit.

286
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,522
And then, that would stick it
to both of them.

287
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,491
No, Jim. I'm not gonna quit.

288
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,629
Then Ryan wins.

289
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,258
Yeah, you're right.

290
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,529
Thanks, you guys.

291
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,370
I just need some alone time.

292
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,531
Okay.

293
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,969
All right, buddy.

294
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,542
Hey. Guys, what's going on?

295
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,674
Nothing.
Hey.

296
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,081
What's up?

297
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,948
Can I hang out
with you guys for a bit?

298
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,488
The warehouse guys are a
bunch of jackasses sometimes.

299
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,990
Come on, people, you know
the rules of the game, now.

300
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,322
Hey, gang.
What game are we playing here?

301
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,419
Okay, it's called,
"Who would you do?"

302
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,455
Oh, I play this at home
all the time

303
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,194
while I'm falling asleep.

304
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,863
What... Where are we?
Where are we here?

305
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,269
Roy.
Roy?

306
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,569
Roy? Who would you do, Roy?

307
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,007
Oh, I got it.
What's the name of that

308
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,073
tight-ass Christian chick.
The blonde?

309
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,844
My name is Angela.

310
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,409
Hey, Angela.
Roy, nice to meet you.

311
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,580
All right, who's next?
Who's next? Who's next?

312
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,784
Who's... Jim? You're next.
Who would you do?

313
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,126
Kevin, hands down.

314
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,031
Yeah, I mean he's really got
that teddy bear thing going on

315
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,334
and afterwards we could
just watch bowling.

316
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:43,273
Well, I would
definitely have sex with Ryan,

317
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,836
'cause he is gonna
own his own business.

318
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,580
You're all gay.

319
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,481
Who's next? Who we got?

320
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,813
Who...
Hey. No, I can talk.

321
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,446
I can talk. I can talk.
Yeah, it's a great time.

322
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,821
Well, I wish I had my cell
phone, but I left it inside, so...

323
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,950
Would that make you happy?

324
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,017
What's that? If you had your cell
phone, it would make you happy?

325
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,426
Yeah.
I'm on it.

326
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,861
Dwight. Hey, Dwight!

327
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,262
You can't go back in yet.

328
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,791
He is an idiot. The man is an
idiot, ladies and gentlemen.

329
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,235
What if he dies in the fire,

330
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,967
and that's the last thing
you ever said to him?

331
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,101
I didn't say it to him.
I said it about him.

332
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,713
Jim?
Definitely Jim.

333
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,342
Definitely, definitely Jim.

334
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,579
Come on, Pam. Come on.

335
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,643
What about you, Pam?

336
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,488
Oscar's kind of cute.

337
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,786
Yeah, I like Oscar.

338
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,490
Ooh, Toby.

339
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:40,029
How long does it take
to find a cell phone?

340
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,896
I don't know either.

341
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,402
Is there anybody else?

342
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,669
Hey, where are you?

343
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,838
Oh, good.

344
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,075
Yeah, we're just here.
We're playing "desert island. "

345
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,376
It's when you pick
your five favorite DVDs.

346
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,973
Seriously,
where the hell is Dwight?

347
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:06,215
Hey, call my cell phone.

348
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,452
It'll make it
easier for him to find.

349
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,557
What's your number?

350
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,188
I gave it to you in the car.

351
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,268
I saw you program it in.

352
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,832
You gotta give it to me again.

353
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,167
Okay. All right.

354
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,400
Now I have it.

355
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,779
Uh...

356
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,120
I better tell somebody.

357
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,820
Excuse me, sir?

358
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,321
Dwight! Dwight!

359
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,264
Oh, God, man!
Why did you go in there?

360
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,564
What? Everybody was scared out
of their wits, man.

361
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,299
Everyone, okay,
I have an announcement.

362
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,009
Apparently,
in business school,

363
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,274
they don't teach you
how to operate a toaster oven,

364
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,945
because some smart, sexy temp
left his cheese pita

365
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,249
on "oven" instead of timing it
for the toaster thing.

366
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,881
Oh, wow, okay.

367
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:18,726
Well, I guess they don't teach how to
operate a toaster oven in business school.

368
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,162
That's exactly what I said.

369
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,132
Hey, did you miss
that day, there, Ryan?

370
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,190
Were you absent?

371
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,394
Toaster Oven 101.

372
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,494
You failed?

373
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,629
I'm so sorry.

374
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,136
Oh, man.

375
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,544
"Hey, I know what'll impress
everybody. I'll start a fire. "

376
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,772
Oh, man.

377
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,680
Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.

378
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,946
I have a song, attention
everyone, that I wanna sing,

379
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,978
that I wrote especially for this occasion
when I was up there among the flames.

380
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,317
Ready?

381
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,951
Ryan started the fire!

382
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,190
It was always burning since
the world's been turning!

383
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,892
Ryan started the fire!
Ryan started the fire!

384
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,128
It was always burning
since the world was turning!

385
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,464
Everybody!

386
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,431
I can't believe
I started the fire.

387
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,769
Marilyn Monroe!

388
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,145
Ryan started the fire!
Ryan started the fire!

389
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,979
It was always burning

390
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,985
Eat it. Yeah, eat it.
You have to eat it.

391
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,213
Hey.
Hey.

392
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,448
How are you?
Good. How are you?

393
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,615
I'm good.
It's good to see you.

394
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,714
Good to see you, too.

395
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,281
I'm hungry.
Yeah, I am, too.

396
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,591
Oh, I have been thinking
the whole way over,

397
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,721
and I have my answers.

398
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:26,821
What answers?

399
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,298
For the "desert island. "

400
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,062
Oh, right! Right, right,
right. Come on, come on.

401
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,933
Ladies and gentlemen, gather
around. We have one more participant.

402
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,973
Come on, be polite. Be polite.

403
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,668
Hi. Desert island, five movies, go.

404
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,371
Okay, first,

405
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,740
Legally Blonde.

406
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,345
I forgot what
a super-nice girl Katy is.

407
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,650
And just good for Jim.
They are so cute together.

408
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,386
And what an adorable car.

409
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,629
Okay, I think the game's over.
People are, like, leaving.

410
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,030
There was a bigger crowd
last time.

411
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,533
Do you wanna just go to lunch?
Okay.

412
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,660
Yeah?
All right.

413
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,760
You wanna drive?
Sure.

414
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:06,997
All right.

415
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,144
They are so cute.

416
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,508
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

417
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,778
Answer me this, though.

418
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,546
What?
Was it worth it?

419
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,985
Was it worth it, temp?
No.

420
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,113
Was it worth it?
Really?

421
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,383
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

422
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,925
The fire guy. The fire guy!

423
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,427
Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon
Studebaker, Television

424
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,827
North Korea, South Korea,
Marilyn Monroe!

425
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,093
Ryan started the fire!

426
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,761
Okay, rule five: Safety first,

427
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,669
i. e. Don't burn
the building down.

428
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,900
Okay?
That should be a no-brainer.

429
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:47,241
Oh, look, Ryan is book smart,

430
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,379
and I am street smart
and book smart.

431
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:56,050
I'll give you
the rest of the 10 tomorrow.
