1
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:39,328
- Hey ya, may I help you on here ?
- I'm all set thank you.

2
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:42,582
Good, I *go with the rows*.
That's a good idea.

3
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:44,336
Today is diversity day,

4
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,594
and someone is going to come in
and talk to us about diversity,

5
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:48,835
something that I've been pushing,

6
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:53,061
that I've been wanting to push for a
long time, and corporate mandated it,

7
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:55,893
I never actually talked
to corporate about it,

8
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,041
they kind of beat me with the punch,

9
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:00,456
those bastards !

10
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:06,015
But I was going to, and I think it's
very important that we have this,

11
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:08,795
I'm very very excited.

12
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,487
That's the thing,
it's a very sturdy paper,

13
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:14,956
and on the back it says :
100% post customer contempt.

14
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:21,468
What ? Hello, haha, wait what ?

15
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,705
I'm sorry mister Decker,
I think I'm losing you.

16
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:32,505
Hello ? Hello ? Yeah, hold on
one sec, hold on one second.

17
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:35,458
- Do you really have to do that right now ?
- Yes I do.

18
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:37,191
I should have done this
weeks ago actually.

19
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:41,955
Mister Decker, I'm sorry about that,
would you wait one second ?

20
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:45,978
Yeah, just one second. Thanks.

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,859
Hello ? That's it, perfect.
So what I was saying was... hello ?

22
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:01,579
- Thanks Dwight.
- "Retaliation". Tit for tit.

23
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:05,722
- That is not the expression.
- Well that should be.

24
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,651
This is my bigger sale of the year.

25
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:17,612
They love me over there, for some
reason, I’m not really sure why,

26
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:21,031
but you know I make one call over there,
every year, just to renew their account.

27
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:25,677
And that one call ends up being 25%
of my commission, for the whole year.

28
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,855
So you know, I buy a mini bottle
of champagne, and celebrate.

29
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:35,116
And this year, I'm pushing recycle
paper on them, for one percent more.

30
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:41,009
I know, getting cocky right.

31
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,154
- Solitaire ?
- Yeah, free cell.

32
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:52,149
- A 6 on 7.
- I know, I saw that.

33
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,159
- So then why didn't you do it ?
- I'm saving that,

34
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:02,276
- cause I like it when the cards go...
- Who doesn't love that ?

35
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:14,641
- Hey ! Oscar, how you doing man ?
- All right.

36
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:16,641
A good week end going there ?

37
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:20,699
- It was fun.
- Oh yeah bet it was fun

38
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:25,337
- Oh hey ! This is Oscar.
- Martinez.

39
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:28,888
- See, I didn't even know, first thing basis.
- We're all set.

40
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:32,081
Oh hey, diversity everybody let's do it.

41
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,447
Oscar works in here.

42
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,726
- Jim can you rapid up please ?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,365
It's diversity day Jim,

44
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,271
wish everyday was diversity day.

45
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:45,616
You know what, I'm actually
gonna have to call you back.

46
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:50,219
Thank you, sorry about that.

47
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:54,748
- Thank you
- Get in the cars ! Get in the car !

48
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:56,832
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

49
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:59,650
Ok thanks for filling these,
I promise this will be quick.

50
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:05,623
At diversity today our philosophy is about
honesty and positive expectations,

51
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:11,311
we believe that 99% of the problems in the
workplace arise simply out of ignorance.

52
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:14,205
You know what ? This is
a color free zone here.

53
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:16,851
Stanley, I don't look
at you as another race.

54
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:21,779
See, this is what I'm talking about, we
don't have to pretend that we're colorblind.

55
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,714
- Exactly. We're not colorblinds.
- That's fighting ignorance with
- With intolerance.

56
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:31,002
No, with more ignorance. Right exactly.
Instead we need to celebrate our diversity.

57
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,711
Let's celebrate.

58
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:37,021
"Celebrate good times. Come on !"
Let's celebrate diversity right ?

59
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:41,772
Yes, exactly. Now, here's what
we're gonna do, I’ve noticed that uh...

60
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:43,723
You know what, here's
what we're gonna do.

61
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:47,878
What if we go around and
everybody, everybody,

62
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:53,332
say a race that you are attracted to
sexually, I will go last. Go.

63
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,928
I have two.
White and Indian.

64
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:58,549
Actually I prefer not to start that way.

65
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:03,385
Michael I would love to have your permission
to run this session, can I have your permission ?

66
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:05,206
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

67
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:07,648
And it would also help me
if you were seated.

68
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:10,009
Thank you. Ok.

69
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:13,821
Now, at the start of the session
I had you write down an incident

70
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:16,562
that you found offensive
in the workplace.

71
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:19,726
- Now what I'm gonna do is choose
one and we're gonna act like...
- A few other ground rules ?

72
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:22,264
Why don't you run it by
me and I run it by him ?

73
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:25,319
OK. Can we steer away from gay people ?

74
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:28,584
I'm sorry it's an orientation,
it's not a race.

75
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:32,322
Plus a lot of other racists
are also intolerant at gays so,

76
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:33,526
paradox.

77
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,990
Well we only have an hour.

78
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,522
- Why don't we just refer to Mr. uh ?
- Mr. brown.

79
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:42,575
Oh all right ! ok !

80
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:44,678
First test, I will not call you that !

81
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,795
Well it's my name it's not a test, ok ?

82
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,441
So. Looking few cards I've noticed that
many of you wrote down the same incident,

83
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:52,190
which is ironic,

84
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:55,813
because it's the exact incident
I was brought in here to respond to.

85
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:59,836
Now how many of you are familiar
with the Chris Rock routine ?

86
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,727
Very good, ok.

87
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,156
<i>How come Chris rock can do a routine,</i>

88
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:10,680
and everybody finds it hilarious,
and ground breaking,

89
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:14,434
and I go into the exact same
routine, same comedy timing,

90
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:17,449
and people file a
complaint to corporate ?

91
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:20,786
Is it because I’m white,
and Chris is black ?

92
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:25,606
So we're gonna reenact this
with a more positive outcome.

93
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:27,575
I will play the Chris rock guy !

94
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,843
I would like to see
someone else pull this off.

95
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:32,535
Oh let's have someone who wasn't
involve in the reenactment ?

96
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:35,486
Ok, I will play guy listening.

97
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:37,005
Great, guy listening.

98
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,710
- Ok anyone else remember ?
- I remember.

99
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,136
Great you're the Chris rock guy
and you're the guy listening.

100
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:45,526
Kevin is a great guy,

101
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:48,778
he's a great accountant, he is
not much of an entertainer.

102
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,162
Basically, there are
two types of black people.

103
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,432
And black people are
actually more racists,

104
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:58,205
because they hate the
other type of black people.

105
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:02,103
Every time the one type
wants to have a good time,

106
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:05,605
then the other type comes in
and makes a real mess.

107
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:11,423
Ok I’m sorry, I’m sorry he's ruining,
he's butchering it, could you just let me...

108
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:15,991
Every time, every time black people
want to have a good time,

109
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:20,434
some biiiip ass biiiip,
I take care of my kids !

110
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:24,259
... always want credit for
something they're supposed to do !

111
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:26,363
Stop it !

112
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:33,288
What do you want ? Cookie ?

113
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:40,846
Now this is a simple acronym, H.E.R.O.

114
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,342
At diversity today we believe
it's very easy to be a hero.

115
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:48,938
All you need are Honesty, Empathy,
Respect and Open mindedness.

116
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:54,204
- Excuse me ? I'm sorry but
that's not all it takes to be a hero.
- Oh great, what is a hero to you ?

117
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,263
A hero kills people.
People that wish him harm.

118
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:57,769
Ok.

119
00:07:57,798 --> 00:08:00,678
A hero is part human, part supernatural,

120
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:05,632
a hero is born out of a child with
trauma, or out of a disaster,

121
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:08,739
that must be avenged.

122
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:15,270
- Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
- We all have a hero in our heart.

123
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,866
Now I need you to take these forms,

124
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,419
this is the kind of expresses the
joint experience we had today.

125
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:28,660
and I want you to look them over and
sign them, as a kind of a group pledge.

126
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:32,951
I don't think I can sign this.

127
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,329
I can't leave until you do.

128
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,981
It says here that I've learned something,

129
00:08:36,985 --> 00:08:40,470
and I knew all this stuff already so...

130
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,650
You know I could sign something
that says that I taught something

131
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:47,883
or that I helped you teach something
so, Pam, where's she ?

132
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:53,756
- Pam could we change something on this ?
- Michael can I talk to you candidly ?

133
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,946
- Sure.
- We both know that I’m here because
of the comments that you've made.

134
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:01,703
Here's the thing, this office,
I think it's very advanced,

135
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:06,740
in terms of racial awareness.

136
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:09,425
And it's probably more advanced
than you're used to.

137
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,079
- That's probably throwing you off.
- It's not throwing me, I need your signature.

138
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:17,679
- Ok I know you told me that, several times.
- Yes, but you're not listening to me,

139
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:20,361
- yours is the only signature I need.
- Oh ok.

140
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,513
Those are my instructions
from the corporate offices

141
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:26,292
is to put your through this seminar,
for the comments that you made,

142
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,596
and the only reason why I made copies for
everyone was that you wouldn’t be embarrassed.

143
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:42,324
Well here I am thinking that you
actually cared about diversity training,

144
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,497
and you don't.

145
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:47,565
- Don't worry about dating.
- I won't.

146
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:53,791
- Ok thank you.
- Yep.

147
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:01,648
I regret my actions, I regret
offending my co-workers.

148
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:07,275
I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty,
empathy, respect and open-mindedness,

149
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:09,366
openmindedness is that a word ?

150
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:13,646
Into the workplace, in this
way I can truly be a hero.

151
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,954
Signed, daffy duck.

152
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,719
He's gonna lose it when he reads that.

153
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,831
Hi, is Mr. Decker around ?

154
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:32,857
Oh well could you just have him
call me after lunch ? Thank you.

155
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:45,262
I pledge to always keep an open
mind and an open heart.

156
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:54,632
I do believe in that part of
the pledge that I just read,

157
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:58,845
but a pledge, come on, who are we ?
The girls scouts ? No.

158
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:05,440
Look, the, the guy Mister brown, he got
us half way there, he got us talking.

159
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,694
Well no, I got us talking.
It got us nothing,

160
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:11,079
he insulted us and he abandoned us.

161
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,228
You call that diversity training ?
I don't.

162
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,952
Were there any connections
between any of us ?

163
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:21,877
Did anyone look each other in the eye,
were there any emotion going on ?

164
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:25,503
No ! Where was the heart,
I didn't see any heart,

165
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:28,256
where was my Oprah moment ?

166
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:34,271
Ok, get as much done as you can
before lunch, because afterward,

167
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:37,921
I’m gonna have you all in tears.

168
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:55,573
All right everybody pretty, come on,
here we go, it's time. Let's do some good.

169
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,486
Hey we are not all gonna seat
in circle in it so are we ?

170
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:02,397
- Get out !
- I'm sorry.

171
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:05,983
No this not a joke, ok ?

172
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:09,610
It was offensive, and lame,
so double offensive.

173
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:17,462
This is an environment of welcoming and
you should just get the hell out of here.

174
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:21,487
Ok let's go, let's do it come on
let's have some fun everybody.

175
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:30,409
Here we go, take a seat, cop a squat,
and thank you for coming in.

176
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:39,063
Diversity... is the cornerstone of
progress, as I’ve always said.

177
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:43,813
But don't take my word for it.
Let's take a look at the tape.

178
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:51,740
Hi I’m Michael Scott, I’m in charge
of Dundler Mifflin paper products

179
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:53,540
here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

180
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:56,740
But I'm also the founder
of diversity tomorrow,

181
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:59,190
because today is almost over.

182
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:06,030
Abraham Lincoln once
said that if you're a racist

183
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:09,340
I will attack you with the north.

184
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:14,374
And those are the principles that
I carry with me in the workplace.

185
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:21,000
Ok, questions ? Comments ?
Anybody, Jim ?

186
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,900
- Uhh, is that it ?
- Yes I only had an hour to put it together,

187
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:28,427
- but I’m gonna add onto it later on.
- It was kind of hard to hear.

188
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:34,217
Uh yes that probably has something to do
with the camera work. Anybody else ?

189
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:38,897
- I have a customer meeting.
- Yeah well if you leave we'll only have to...

190
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:43,103
Yes, enjoy, absolutely.
"Namaste".

191
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:46,437
Ok, well, since I am leading this

192
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:52,248
let's get down to business, and why
don't I, just kind of introduce myself, ok ?

193
00:13:52,835 --> 00:14:00,781
I am Michael, and I am part
English, Irish, German, and Scottish,

194
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:04,030
sort of a virtual United Nations.

195
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:09,683
But what some of you might not know,
is that I am also part native American Indian.

196
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:11,988
What part, native American ?

197
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:15,271
- 2/15th
- That fraction doesn't make any sense.

198
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:19,415
Well, you know what it's kinda hard
for me to talk about it. It's suffering

199
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:23,336
So who else ? Let's get it popping,
come on. Whose gone ?

200
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:27,239
Let's go here, Oscar,
right here, you're on !

201
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,260
Ok Michael, both my parents
were born in Mexico

202
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,943
and they moved to the united-states
a year before I was born,

203
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:43,100
so I grew up in the united states and
my parents were Mexicans.

204
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:47,059
That is a great story, that's the
American dream right there, right ?

205
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:49,117
Thank you, yeah

206
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:55,199
Let me ask you is there a term
besides Mexican, that you prefer ?

207
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:57,412
Something less offensive ?

208
00:14:57,456 --> 00:15:01,009
- Mexican isn't offensive !
- Well it has certain connotations.

209
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:05,713
- Like what ?
- Like... I don't know

210
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:07,413
- What connotations Michael ?
- No...

211
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:09,780
- It must have been something
- No, remember

212
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:14,793
- I'm just curious
- Honesty, Empathy, Respect,

213
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,451
Jim ?

214
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:19,566
Hello ?

215
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:23,890
I have something here,
I want you to take a card

216
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:26,690
put it on you fore...
don't look at the card !

217
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:30,432
I want you to take the card, I want
you to put it on you forehead and

218
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:33,671
take a card, any card

219
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:38,338
and I want you to treat other
people like the race

220
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:42,937
that is on their forehead.
So everybody has a different race

221
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:47,061
nobody knows what
their race is, so

222
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,298
I want you to really go for it,
cause this is real

223
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:53,860
you know this isn't just an
exercise this is real life and

224
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:59,451
I have a dream that you
all really let this spark fly

225
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:01,274
get it done !

226
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,705
Why ? Because Martin Luther
King is a hero of mine

227
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:09,790
There's this great Chris Rock bit about
how streets named after Martin Luther King,

228
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,440
tend to be more violent.

229
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:15,354
I'm not gonna do it but it's

230
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,266
oh this is a good one

231
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:20,744
- Hum, hi how are you ?
- Fine, how are you ?

232
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,425
- Push it
- Great

233
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,440
I admire your culture success in America.

234
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:28,040
Thank you.

235
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:35,344
Come on ! Olympics of sufferings right here
Slavery versus Holocaust, come on !

236
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:37,531
- Whom am I supposed to be ?
- It's called role play

237
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:41,060
well, that was an invert,
we didn't actually plan that

238
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,192
Lot's of cultures eat rice,
That doesn't help me

239
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:50,479
- Shalom, I'd like to apply for a loan.
- That's nice, Dwight.

240
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:53,080
OK, do me. Something stereotypical
so I can get it really quick.

241
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:55,640
OK, I like your food.

242
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,895
Uh, Outback Steakhouse,
I'm Australian, mate !

243
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,925
- No...
- Pam..."I like your food"?

244
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,732
No come on, stir the pot.
Stir the melting pot, Pam !

245
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,946
Let's do it, let's get ugly,
let's get real.

246
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,740
OK, if I have to do this,

247
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,640
based on stereotypes that are totally
untrue, that I do not agree with,

248
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,840
you would maybe not be
a very good driver.

249
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,640
Aw man, am I a woman ?

250
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,836
You'll notice, I didn't
have anybody being Arab.

251
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:27,231
I thought that would be too
explosive, uh, no pun intended.

252
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:30,340
But I just thought, "too soon" for Arabs.

253
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:35,647
Maybe next year.
You know, the ball's in their court.

254
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,405
- What's you're watching ?
- Supershow

255
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:39,843
- really ?
- Yeah, I downloaded it on her computer

256
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:44,965
- I hope she doesn't mind,
she has a lot of extra space.
- No way ! I think she really likes this stuff

257
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:49,723
- she's cute hein ?
- Yeah, she's engaged but

258
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:56,685
- oh, no, the girl on the... sketch
- oh, yeah, she's hot

259
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:59,512
- Hey.
- Hey.

260
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:03,478
- You wanna go to the beach ?
- Sure.

261
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:06,928
- You wanna get high ?
- No.

262
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:09,909
- I think you do, mon.
- Stop it

263
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:15,983
you need to push it, you know
you could go a little bit further

264
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:23,406
- Kelly, how are you ?
- I've had one of the longest meeting I've ever...

265
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,267
Welcome to my convenient store.
Would you like some gookie cookie ?

266
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,840
I have some very delicious gookie
cookie, only 99 cents plus taxes

267
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:36,634
try my gookie cookie

268
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:51,778
all right, yes

269
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,939
that was great, she gets it

270
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:59,464
now she knows what
it's like to be a minority.

271
00:19:03,368 --> 00:19:07,747
Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your
sell day do we ? Excellent, ok

272
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:12,221
Let me just get your... what's that ?

273
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:15,098
No we didn't close last time...

274
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:18,007
I just need your...

275
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:22,743
oh, what code were you given

276
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:25,150
oh ok

277
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:29,917
yeah, no that's actually another sells-man here,
yeah, I can re-do it if you want to do that

278
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:32,912
oh he gave you discount ?
No, I don't blame you

279
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:35,513
I just hated it when that guy was in here,

280
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:39,272
Mr. brown ? If that was his real name !?

281
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:44,331
I mean, he had never met any of us before,
and here he was telling us how to do our things

282
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:49,843
I just wanted to do it our way, you know ?

283
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,154
On our own

284
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:55,642
man I should have gotten some food

285
00:19:55,753 --> 00:20:01,188
- maybe some spaghetti
- ok, Kevin you can take off that thing, ok ?

286
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:06,932
That would have really
showed him up, wouldn't it ?

287
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:14,697
I've brought some burritos, some color
greens, some pad thai, love pad thai

288
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:19,175
it's colored greens

289
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:22,745
doesn't really make sense, cause
you don't call it colored people

290
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,904
that's offensive

291
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:33,534
ok, it's after five, so
thank you very much

292
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:37,109
Buena vista Oscar
thank you

293
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,222
good job
oh my man !

294
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:46,919
Thank you brazil
nice

295
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,743
hey, we can go

296
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:16,591
not a bad day !
