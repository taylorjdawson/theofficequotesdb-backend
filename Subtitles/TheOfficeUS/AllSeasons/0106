1
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:38,762
- Are you listening to me Michael ?
- Affirmative.

2
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:40,765
What did I just say ?

3
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:44,872
You just said...
let me check my notes,

4
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,408
you just said...

5
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,015
Alan and I have created
an incentive program-

6
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:53,645
Hey ! Hey how is Alan ?
Tell Alan that the Mets suck.

7
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,279
Ok ? From me, big time. Go Pirates !

8
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:58,661
- No I'm not gonna do that.
- Ok.

9
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:00,990
We've created an incentive
program to increase sales.

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,378
At the end of the month you can
reward your top seller with a prize,

11
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:05,565
worth up to one thousand dollars.

12
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:09,116
Wo ! Howdy-ho. A thousand big ones.
That's cool.

13
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,052
Do I get to pick the prize ?

14
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:13,462
Uh, yes, yes you can.

15
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:18,852
Question : does top salesman
include people who were at one time,

16
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:22,791
such outstanding salesmen
that they've been promoted to...

17
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:26,373
No Michael, you can't win this prize.

18
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:28,263
I didn't mean me !

19
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:36,320
Well, first what we
have to do is find out

20
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:38,903
what motivates people
more than anything else ?

21
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,901
Sex.

22
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:42,111
It's illegal, can't do that.
Next best thing.

23
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:42,900
Torture.

24
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,872
Come on Dwight. Just, help me
out here. This is stupid.

25
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:47,910
- Michael ?
- Pam !

26
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,660
- There's...
- Burger with cheese.

27
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,553
- There's a person here...
- And fries.

28
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:53,651
- There's...
- And shake. What, ? go ahead.

29
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:55,883
There's a person here
who wants to sell handbags.

30
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,682
No vendors in the office.
That is a distraction.

31
00:01:58,895 --> 00:02:01,713
- Ok I told her you'd talk to her at least.
- Pam come on I'm busy,

32
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:04,651
- so just tell her to go away.
- Ok.

33
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,792
Alright I'll talk to her.

34
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:13,963
This one is hand-embroidered.

35
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,743
Alright girls, break it up,
you're being infiltrated.

36
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:17,860
Cock in the henhouse.

37
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:19,991
- Cocks in the henhouse !
- Don't say cocks.

38
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,540
Oh, What is you name my fair lass ?

39
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:26,783
- Katy.
- Oh Katy.

40
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,003
Wow ! Look at you !

41
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:33,282
You're like the new and
improved Pam. Pam 6.0.

42
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,960
Look, oh, hey, no cat fights you two,

43
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:39,901
- I'm against violence in the workplace.
- So am I.

44
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:41,623
- Nobody cares what you think.
- Doesn't matter.

45
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:43,553
So you know what ?

46
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:46,040
I usually don't allow
solicitors in the office,

47
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:48,952
but today I am going
to break some rules,

48
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:51,351
and you can have the conference room.
It's yours, all day.

49
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,643
- Wow, thanks.
- There's a H.R. meeting there at 11 :30.

50
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,553
Well, let's put them in the hallway.

51
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,752
We'll give them some chairs. Right ?

52
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:04,440
Decisiveness, one of the keys to success,
according to "Small Businessman".

53
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,673
I do, I read "small businessman",

54
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:10,473
I also subscribe to "USA today",

55
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,531
and "American Way Magazine".

56
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:16,951
That's the in-flight magazine,
some great articles in that.

57
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:23,033
They did this great profile
last month of Doris Roberts,

58
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,241
and where she likes to eat
when she's in Phoenix.

59
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:27,950
Illuminating.

60
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:30,043
This is my conference room,

61
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:32,790
so please, make yourself at home.

62
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:35,671
Whatever you need, I'm right
on the other side of this wall,

63
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:39,210
there used to be a window here,
there's not anymore.

64
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,082
So that's where I will be.

65
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:45,970
So if you need anything else,
something to make you more comfortable,

66
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:49,562
just don't hesitate to ask, I'm right here.

67
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:54,572
- I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
- Wait a second.

68
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:59,361
I should have spotted another addict.
Gotta love the "bucks".

69
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:00,491
What ?

70
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:03,133
It's like a slang for Starbucks,
they're all over the place.

71
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:07,080
Oh man, that place is like
the promised land, to me...

72
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:09,193
What a business model too.

73
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,062
- Too bad we don't have the good stuff here.
- A regular coffee is fine.

74
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:16,312
- No it's not, it's...
- No, really, it is.

75
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,880
No, here's the thing, you know,

76
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:26,111
I do my best to be my own man and...

77
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,941
go by the beat of a different drummer.

78
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:30,913
And nobody gets me,

79
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,892
and they're always putting up walls,
and I'm always tearing them down,

80
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:37,112
just breaking down barriers,
that's what I do all day.

81
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:48,072
So, a coffee, regular coffee, for you.
High test or unleaded ?

82
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:52,903
- Bring it on. Yeah.
- Woo, I will. I'll bring it on. Alright.

83
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:55,932
So,

84
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,913
are you jealous,
because there's another girl around ?

85
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:00,992
No.

86
00:05:02,397 --> 00:05:04,352
She's prettier than you though.

87
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:10,923
That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.

88
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:18,471
... suit you. I can see
you pairing it with gloves.

89
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:21,253
The purse girl hits
everything on my checklist.

90
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,641
Creamy skin,

91
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,031
straight teeth,

92
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:25,580
curly hair,

93
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:27,751
amazing breasts...

94
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:29,780
Not for me... for my children.

95
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:33,113
The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.

96
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,660
There you go,
nice steaming hot cup of joe.

97
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:37,430
- Thank you.
- I've an idea.

98
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,452
Why don't I introduce you around ?

99
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:42,963
You know, you can kind of get your foot
in the door, meet potential clientele.

100
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:43,450
Right ?

101
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:47,450
Gosh  I would love to,
but my purses, I should...

102
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:51,502
Oh, we can have Ryan take a look, Ryan
would you look after the purses please ?

103
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:54,913
I'm installing file share
on all the computers.

104
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:57,801
Technobable,  just do it ok ?
we have company.

105
00:05:57,897 --> 00:05:58,432
Right ?

106
00:05:58,507 --> 00:05:59,941
You should sell a lot here,

107
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:03,010
because  this branch made
over a million dollars last year.

108
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:05,441
Not that we're all millionaires,
I'm probably closest,

109
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:09,473
Here is Oscar ! Oscar, this is Katie.

110
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:10,291
I'm on the phone.

111
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:14,513
Ooh ooh, Oscar the Grouch. Right ?
Yeah, I thought of that. Yeah.

112
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:18,500
- That was on "Sesame street"
- I know, I made the connection.

113
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:21,022
Can you believe he'd never heard
that before he worked here ?

114
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:24,182
- No I don't believe that.
- I know it's unbelievable.

115
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,240
It's nice having Katie around.

116
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:29,712
It's another person for Michael to...

117
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:32,482
interact with.

118
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:37,611
Here is Toby for human ressources.
Katy, Toby. Toby, Katy.

119
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:40,653
Hey did you go to Bishop O'Hara ?

120
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:42,290
- Yeah.
- Yeah me too.

121
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:43,662
- What class...
- Cool what year were you there ?

122
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:44,030
89...

123
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:45,811
Toby's divorced. He...

124
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:48,020
god, recently right ?

125
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:50,801
You and your wife, and you have kids ?

126
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,713
- I have a girl.
- That's so...

127
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:54,300
That was really messy.

128
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:57,350
You slept one night in your car, too ?

129
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:04,022
- I should probably get back to my table.
- Ok, alright. Cool, see you in a bit.

130
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,020
Oh, she's cute.

131
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,420
Cutie pie. Back to work !

132
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:14,120
I live by one rule :

133
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:18,913
No office romances.
No way, very messy, inapropriate,

134
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:21,252
No.

135
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:22,410
But,

136
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:24,341
I live by another rule :

137
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:26,373
Just do it.

138
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:28,323
Nike.

139
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:31,863
Hey Jimmy, what do you think
about that little purse girl ?

140
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:33,650
Cute sure.

141
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,783
- Why don't you get on that ?
- She's not really my type.

142
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:39,072
What are you, gay ?

143
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,798
I don't think so. Nope.

144
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,285
What is your type ?

145
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:48,506
Moms, primarily, yeah,

146
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:52,822
soccer moms, single moms,
nascar moms, any type of mom really.

147
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:54,023
That's disgusting.

148
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:56,220
- Stay away from my mom.
- Too late Kevin.

149
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:05,112
Man I would be all over that
if I wasn't dating Pam.

150
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:08,671
We're not dating we're engaged.

151
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:10,790
Engaged yeah.

152
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:26,681
Pam and I are good buddies.

153
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:29,480
I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy,
for her problems.

154
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:31,780
You know with stuff like work,

155
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:34,542
or her fiancé Roy,

156
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:40,043
Nope those are pretty much
her only two problems.

157
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,231
She'd be perfect for you.

158
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,630
- She's been talking to Michael a lot.
- So what ?

159
00:08:47,186 --> 00:08:50,033
- You're assistant regional manager.
- Assistant to the regional manager.

160
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:52,731
You know what Dwight,
he's your work boss, ok ?

161
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:55,190
- He's not your relationship boss.
- That's true.

162
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:57,801
Plus you have so much more
to talk to this girl about.

163
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:03,173
You're both salesmen, I mean
that's something right there.

164
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:04,062
True.

165
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,911
Plus I can talk to her about
the origins of my last name.

166
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:09,852
It's all gold.

167
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,302
Guys are usually my best customers,

168
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:16,812
they buy the high-end stuff, like
the beads and the sequins and stuff,

169
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:18,600
for gifts, you know.

170
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:22,451
They don't know what they're
looking at so... I make suggestions.

171
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,282
Alight, here the thing, ok ?
Just keep talking to her.

172
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:27,360
If you hit a stall you have
a perfect fall back.

173
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:28,960
- What's that ?
- You buy a purse.

174
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:32,580
- I don't want a purse, purses are for girls.
- Dwight, that's not necessarily true.

175
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,070
- Do you read GQ ?
- No.

176
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:38,572
Ok I do, they're like mini briefcases.
Alright, lots of guys have them.

177
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,150
- Like those ?
- Yes !

178
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:42,953
Listen, you are spending way
too much time talking to me

179
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:45,492
- when you could be talking to her.
- Ok I'm just gonna use the bathroom and

180
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:45,493
No !

181
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:48,412
You don't need the bathroom.
You've got it. Go.

182
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:57,451
Ok, shh. Stop, whatever you're doing,
cause this is going to be good.

183
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,812
"Hi my name is Dwigth Schrute and
I would like to buy a purse from you.

184
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:06,883
Good lord look at these purses !
This is something special.

185
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:12,113
Oh my god !
Is this Salvatore de Chini... asta ?

186
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:14,762
Oh definitely, definitely
step in and out of it like that.

187
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,200
- Yes.
- You put it on...

188
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:20,451
Well I want to stress test it,
you know, in case anything happens.

189
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:23,921
Oh, that was really...

190
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:27,990
this is necessary to do,
to really give it a good workout.

191
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,910
This is the ohhh,
this is the prettiest one of all !

192
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:35,051
I'm gonna be the
prettiest girl in the ball.

193
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:39,840
- Oh how much ?
- Oh god it's sad, it's so sad.

194
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:41,361
Here he comes, shh.

195
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,921
- He did pick a good one.
- You're horrible !

196
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:53,011
This one's really good for a hot date.

197
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,940
Yeah what's that ? I'm engaged.

198
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:58,351
Oh congratulations. You need
a hot date more than anyone.

199
00:10:58,508 --> 00:10:59,751
I wish, right ?

200
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:06,613
I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets Of
The Ya-Ya Sisterhood over here. Right ?

201
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:11,502
- So how was that coffee from earlier ?
- It was good.

202
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:16,211
I knew it. Guzzled it down,
you greedy little thing.

203
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,882
So Pam, is this your lunch break or

204
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:24,802
was that earlier when you were eating
in the kitchen with those guys ?

205
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:29,601
- Sorry.
- Busted !

206
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:31,470
- Come back.
- Oh hey,

207
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:34,042
I want to show you something, come here.

208
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,011
I know you are going to like this. I
picked it up today, a thousand big ones.

209
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:42,362
- Is that from starbucks ?
- Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista.

210
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,951
This is the Mack Daddy
of espresso makers.

211
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:48,422
- Is that for the office ?
- I know what you're thinking.

212
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:51,233
You're not prying this out of my hands.

213
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:55,570
- Don't tempt me because I'll give it to you.
- I wouldn't think of it.

214
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:58,730
Coffee is the great
incentivizer in the office.

215
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:03,872
It's a drug. It is quite literally
a drug, that speeds people up.

216
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:06,013
It's not the only drug
that speeds people up.

217
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:09,723
You hear stories about
Dunder Mifflin in the'80s,

218
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:12,473
before everybody knew
how bad cocaine was.

219
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:15,223
God... MAN, did they move paper.

220
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:19,881
Oh the rotating steam... wand.

221
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,261
- What ? what's the matter ?
- Oh nothing,

222
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,601
my ride just bailed on me.

223
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:31,913
God, I'm sorry, where are you going ?
nearby ? Because I could give you a ride.

224
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:32,550
No.

225
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:35,263
- Sure ?
- I don't want to inconvenience you.

226
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:38,592
God !No no no inconvenience.
I'm out of here at five sharp.

227
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,052
- At five ?
- I can go earlier,

228
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:44,790
because I'm the boss, you know.
Whatever. I'm out of here, slaves.

229
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,252
Ok.

230
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,241
- What ?
- Ok.

231
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,211
Ok.

232
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:51,521
Ok I guess that would be ok.

233
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:55,690
Sounds  good, five o clock sharp, I will
give you and your purses a ride home.

234
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:57,930
- Ok. Cool.
- Excellent. Great. Great.

235
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,200
- Cool.
- Cool.

236
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,421
I should never have let
the temp touch this thing.

237
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,793
I had all these great icons and
now I have four folders, so...

238
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:16,632
- It's actually better this way.
- No it's not,

239
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:19,551
because I could just click on the
icon and then I'm onto something

240
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,273
Michael could I ask you something ?

241
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:24,001
I wanted to ask your
permission to ask out Katy.

242
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:28,060
- I know it's against the rules and everything...
- No it's not against the rules,

243
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:32,752
- She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
- Thank you Michael. I appreciate this so much...

244
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:38,002
But I think that you should just know that
I am going to be giving her a ride home later.

245
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,161
What ?

246
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:43,401
She asked me for a ride, and so
I'm going to give her a ride home.

247
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:47,430
Is that all it is, just a ride home ?
Like a taxi-cab ?

248
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,052
Well, might be a ride home,

249
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:56,841
might be a ride home and we stop
for coffee and... dot, dot, dot.

250
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:04,622
Please, please, I am your inferior,
and I'm asking you this favor,

251
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:08,781
can you promise me that
it will just be a ride home ?

252
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,142
- No. I cannot promise you...
- You cannot promise me,

253
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,911
- or you won't promise me ?
- Listen, Dwight.

254
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,492
- Do you love her ?
- Dwight no.

255
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:21,783
I don't know,

256
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,210
it's too early to tell,

257
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:27,853
I don't know how I feel.

258
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:36,133
I think you've made a really good
choice she's really gonna like that.

259
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:37,551
Espresso ?

260
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,700
- Oh thank you.
- You're welcome.

261
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:47,043
Is that from the machine
that was in your office ?

262
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:50,323
I thought that was the incentive
prize for the top salesperson ?

263
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:51,620
Very easy to clean.

264
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:53,322
Ok.

265
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:57,301
Like he's gonna win it anyway. Right ?

266
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,341
- So did we get any mail ?
- Yeah I gave it to you.

267
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,351
Yes you did.

268
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,833
Just checking, double checking,
checking on the check.

269
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,641
Thoroughness is very important
in an office.

270
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:17,641
- And...
- So can I...

271
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,270
Yeah of course.

272
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:23,791
Pam, one more thing, how do girls
of your age feel about futons ?

273
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:27,770
A futon ? He's a grown man.

274
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,781
- That's what he said.
- That's sad.

275
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:36,161
Or it's innovative. You know the futon
in a bed and couch all rolled into one.

276
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,771
- What's up ?
- Hey !

277
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,511
- Are you still mad at me ?
- Roy.

278
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,260
- Come on.
- Cut it out.

279
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:45,480
- Come on, are you mad at me ?
- Stop it.

280
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:48,100
- Are you still mad at me now ?
- Cut it out !

281
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,013
Come on !

282
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,263
Come on Pammy !

283
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:53,870
- Stop I can't breathe.
- I was just kidding.

284
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,272
You know I didn't mean it.

285
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:59,190
Jim is a great guy,
he's like a brother to me.

286
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,670
We're like best friends in the office.

287
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:04,470
I really hope he finds someone.

288
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,162
You seem to like to touch things,
you should try the velvet.

289
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:13,833
I don't like to necessarily touch
things, I'm just... I'm shopping.

290
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:15,923
Oh no it's fine that you...

291
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:19,772
Here. What about the raspberry one ?

292
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:24,240
It's really kind of festive,
it's got a lot of personality.

293
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,241
Yeah no.

294
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:28,260
Hey,  how's it going, good can I talk
to you for a second, in private ?

295
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:30,322
- I don't think so, I'm busy.
- It'll just take a second.

296
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:31,143
- I can't.
- Just for a minute,

297
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,623
- Please.
- I really can't.

298
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:37,513
I wanted to talk to you in private because
I wanted to ask you out on a date.

299
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,311
No !

300
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:51,802
Okay, was that no to talking to me in
private or was that no to the date ?

301
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:53,630
Both.

302
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:05,953
- What colors do you like ?
- Grey, dark grey, charcoal...

303
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:07,580
- Ryan ?
- Yeah ?

304
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:11,651
- Would you like to help me with a special project ?
- I'd love to.

305
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:17,142
- OK just throw out all the empties.
- You don't want to recycle them ?

306
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:20,921
Yes, throw them away
in the recycling bin.

307
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:23,252
Do you want this ?

308
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,190
No.

309
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,681
What about this bottle of power drink ?

310
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,102
- What flavor ?
- Blue.

311
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:33,853
- Blue is not a flavor.
- It says flavor : blue blast.

312
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:36,113
Oh blue blast.
Yes, put that in the trunk.

313
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,402
And there should be an unopened
Arctic Chill back there.

314
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:41,703
I want that in the passanger's
cup holder. Thank you.

315
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:52,532
- Hi.
- Hi !

316
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,383
- I'm Jim, by the way.
- I'm Katy.

317
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:56,083
- Hi Katy, nice to meet you.
- You sit out there don't you ?

318
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:59,043
I do. That's what I'm best known for,

319
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:00,053
sitting out there.

320
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,412
Alright let's talk about purses.

321
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:04,223
- Ok uh...
- Katy, but,

322
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:07,692
you know what ? Don't try
to sell me one, ok ? Seriously.

323
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:10,040
Because I'm just here to learn.

324
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:10,410
Ok.

325
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:13,180
- So I know about most of these, but...
- Ok.

326
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:16,113
What's up ? Whoa ! That's my Drakkar Noir.

327
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:19,590
- No, this is Rite Aid - Night Sweat.
- No, it is a perfect smell-alike.

328
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:22,033
I'm not paying for the label.
Right here, give it.

329
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:25,603
- Well it's empty.
- No it's not, there's some in the straw.

330
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,940
There now you may throw it out.

331
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,991
- How many Filet-O-Fishes did you eat ?
- That's over several months, Ryan.

332
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:41,192
Still.

333
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,763
- What's up ?
- I'm bored.

334
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:47,112
Thank you, for chosing me.

335
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:51,670
No I'm kidding. So you got
big plans this weekend ?

336
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:55,622
Well I think I'm gonna see Katie.

337
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:57,933
- Really ?
- Yeah.

338
00:18:58,557 --> 00:19:02,970
- What are you guys going to do ?
- Oh man, I don't know. Dinner.

339
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:06,861
Drinks, movie, matching tattoos.

340
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:10,210
- That's great. That's cool.
- Big stuff. Yeah.

341
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:13,701
- What are you doing ?
- I was going to say that I think,

342
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:16,300
- We're going to help Roy's cousin move.
- Okay.

343
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:18,191
Because Roy's got a truck.

344
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:20,951
That's cool.

345
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,843
- Yes.
- That is cool.

346
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,970
- I'll see you Monday, though, right ?
- Great.

347
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:29,890
- I'm gonna head back.
- Alright.

348
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,232
I think in order to be a ladies'man,

349
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:41,092
it's imperative that people
don't know you're a ladies'man,

350
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:43,800
so I kind of play that close to the chest.

351
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:48,922
I don't know, what can I say ? women
are attracted to power. And I think,

352
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:52,890
other people have told me
I have a very symmetrical face.

353
00:19:55,077 --> 00:20:01,811
So I don't know, maybe
they're right, I don't know.

354
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:16,941
Sure you don't want me to help you with that ?
Cause I can grab that no problem.

355
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:16,910
Goodnight. It was nice to meet some of you.

356
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:19,793
See you later. Goodnight.

357
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,513
- Goodnight Jim.
- Goodnight Michael.

358
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:25,280
Where are you going ?

359
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:27,790
I do'nt know, grab a drink, I think.

360
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:30,741
With us ?

361
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:36,122
I probably should have told you. I don't need a
ride now cause Jim can take me home after. So,

362
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:39,012
- You're off the hook.
- Okay great. Off the hook, excellent. Okay cool.

363
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:40,653
- I got this.
- Alright, have fun.

364
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:42,331
- Thank you
- Don't drink and drive.

365
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:45,270
-  Take it easy !
- Have a good night !

366
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:48,703
- You too. Have a good night.
- You got that ?

367
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:51,722
- You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
- Yeah.

368
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:55,133
Here.

369
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:57,742
Squeeze it inside.

370
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:00,002
Now, I'm gonna warn you,

371
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,743
- Don't freak out. Okay ?
- Why ?

372
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:05,523
This is a really nice car. In case you
haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay ?

373
00:21:05,536 --> 00:21:09,052
- It's a- It's a very nice car.
- So you're not going to freak out.

374
00:21:09,357 --> 00:21:12,660
Do I have a special someone ?

375
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:15,530
Well, yeah. Of course. A bunch of them.

376
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:17,541
My employees.

377
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:22,732
If I had to choose between a one-night stand
with some stupid cow I'd pick up at a bar,

378
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:25,540
and these people,
I'd pick them every time.

379
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,153
Because with them, it is an every-day stand.

380
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:35,050
And I still know their names
in the morning.
