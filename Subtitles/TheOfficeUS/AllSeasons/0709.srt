1
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,572
Uh-oh.
Okay, okay, nobody panic.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,478
Listen up, listen up.

3
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:11,549
Everyone, follow me
to the shelter.

4
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:13,716
We've got enough food
for 14 days.

5
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:16,535
After that, we have
a difficult conversation.

6
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:17,652
My bad.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,639
Space heater and fan
were both on high,

8
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:22,493
plugged into
the same outlet, so...

9
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:24,236
Uh, it's saying the server
went down?

10
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:26,515
Does anybody know that password?

11
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,794
'Cause otherwise,
we can't do any work.

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,166
Uh...Try "password."

13
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:31,301
Nope.

14
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:34,779
Try zero, zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero.

15
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:36,481
No.

16
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:40,220
Okay, now try zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero, one.

17
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:41,858
Okay, I'm not doing
every number.

18
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:44,497
Wait, um, does anyone remember
when it was set up?

19
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:47,237
Uh...lt was, like,
eight years ago?

20
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:48,841
<i>Lord of the Rings stuff?</i>

21
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:50,177
I don't know, I'm just trying
to think of things

22
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:51,816
that were happening
at the time.

23
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,818
Um, everyone was getting
their driver's license.

24
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:57,122
Why don't we just call the
I.T. guy who set it up?

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,557
What's the name of the guy
in glasses, again?

26
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,324
Okay, moving backwards,
our I.T. guys have been...

27
00:01:01,392 --> 00:01:03,762
Glasses, turban, ear hair,

28
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,466
fatty 3, shorts, fatty 2,
lozenge,

29
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,701
and fatso.

30
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,472
I think lozenge was the one
who installed it.

31
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,474
I got it.

32
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:15,282
Try, um...

33
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:17,784
You know what, it made me
laugh when I heard it,

34
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:19,119
but Pam got really offended.

35
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:22,124
Big boobs.

36
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:23,125
Drama queen?

37
00:01:23,193 --> 00:01:24,861
Nosy?

38
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,296
You're typing "big boobs"?

39
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:27,298
I'm trying everything.

40
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:28,568
Try "big boobs" with a "z."

41
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:29,568
That's...

42
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:31,503
The password. We're in.

43
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:32,705
- All right.
- Wow.

44
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:33,705
Yes.

45
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:34,706
The important thing is...

46
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:36,309
This kept us secure, people.

48
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:07,182
- Morning.
- How's it going?

49
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:10,919
- Hey, I'm WUPHF.
- I'm Facebook.

50
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:12,053
What's up, Facebook?

51
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:13,989
I sent you a Facebook message
yesterday,

52
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:15,257
I still haven't heard
anything back.

53
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:16,258
You should've sent me a WUPHF.

54
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:17,260
A what?

55
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:18,394
When you send a WUPHF,

56
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:19,562
it goes to your home phone,
cell phone,

57
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,498
email, Facebook, Twitter,
and home screen.

58
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:22,499
All at the same time.

59
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:26,070
WUPHF.

60
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:27,071
WUPHF!

61
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,473
Dot-com!

62
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:36,115
Thanks, Erin.

63
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:39,287
Sure.

64
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:40,922
- Pam.
- Mm-hmm?

65
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,056
I don't wanna be
a lousy snitch.

66
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:44,159
Okay.

67
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:46,294
Ryan has been using the color
printer for his business a lot,

68
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:47,295
and as office administrator...

69
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:48,563
Oh, it's okay.

70
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:50,299
But it's not for...

71
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:51,567
Let it go.

72
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:53,335
Yes, I invested in WUPHF.

73
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:54,837
It's actually
a really great idea,

74
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:57,006
and I can't believe
it didn't exist before.

75
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,208
And I know Ryan's kind of
a sketchy guy,

76
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:00,743
but hey, I married Jim.

77
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,278
I've done my part
for the nice guy.

78
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:04,014
Now I want a bedroom set.

79
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:06,316
I think an investors ski trip,
frankly,

80
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:08,585
is the best idea.

81
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:10,387
It will be a bonding experience.

82
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:11,522
I love it.

83
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:12,923
I was looking at a trail map,

84
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,759
and I was thinking that we
should start on a bunny hill,

85
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,728
because I've never
actually been skiing.

86
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,630
And then work our way up

87
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,899
to death drop.

88
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,535
Great, so we got our first
offer to buy the company.

89
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,603
You're kidding.

90
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,006
We could sell,
but why think so small?

91
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,309
We can just get a couple
more people involved,

92
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,477
really do this thing our way.

93
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:31,679
You and me, baby.

94
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:32,747
New investors are key, though.

95
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:34,182
That's actually
why I came in today.

96
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,251
Don't you work here full time?

97
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:38,820
Today I was thinking
I would sit down

98
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:40,422
with a few of the people
who haven't invested yet.

99
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,558
- Mm-hmm.
- Or we could do that together.

100
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:43,693
If that sounds fun to you.

101
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,896
That does sound fun to me.

102
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,631
Awesome.

103
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,801
Ah, this is good hay.

104
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:52,470
Yeah.

105
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,770
This is the good stuff.
Mattress quality.

106
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:56,337
Every fall, growing up,

107
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:59,205
my Uncle Eldred used to build us
a maze out of hay bales

108
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,807
for us kids to play in.

109
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,876
We called it hay place.

110
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,678
Eldred called it hay world.

111
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,747
Eventually, lawyers
were brought in.

112
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,116
But that's all behind us.

113
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:11,451
Hay place lives on.

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,553
Watch it, watch it.

115
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,455
Hello!
Welcome to hay place.

116
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:16,890
A place for hay.

117
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,291
Don't forget to make a broom.

118
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,159
Oh, the petting zoo
closes at 2:00,

119
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,127
and the goat roast
is at 3:00.

120
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,761
Come on in, enjoy!

121
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,196
Hey.

122
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:28,599
I'm kind of in the mood
for a roll in the hay.

123
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,300
Roll in the hay, five dollars.

124
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,469
No, I meant...

125
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,338
Oh, our contract.

126
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:36,539
Mm-hmm.

127
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:39,542
Yes, why don't we meet
at the usual spot.

128
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,743
Uh...

129
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:43,177
I've got a half an hour
during lunch

130
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:44,712
in-between the historical
reenactment

131
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,246
of the Dunmore farm slaughters
and the onion boil.

132
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:48,480
- Perfect.
- So, uh...

133
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:49,581
Excuse me, get off of there.

134
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:52,717
Those are show bales,
not play bales.

135
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:53,952
All right, thank you, I will...

136
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,020
I will send the contracts over
right away.

137
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,087
All right.

138
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,428
Whoo!

139
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,163
I am on the first hot sale
streak of my life.

140
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,797
I think it all comes from
feeding Cece,

141
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,433
because no matter
how much she resists,

142
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,134
I sell her those carrots.

143
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:13,535
Let's be honest...

144
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:16,671
If I can make mushed carrots
seem better than a boob...

145
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:19,407
I can pretty much
sell anything.

146
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:21,509
Commission comes out to...

147
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,710
Dunh-duh-na-dah!

148
00:05:23,778 --> 00:05:25,011
Zero.

149
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,979
Mm-kay, well,
it can't be zero, Kev.

150
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,314
I entered the sale,

151
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:30,716
and I hit enter,

152
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:31,984
and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!"

153
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:34,787
I'm pretty sure
I timed it right.

154
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:36,455
You met your commission cap
last week.

155
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:38,223
So from here until the end
of the fiscal year,

156
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,358
your commission will be zero.

157
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,358
What are you talking about?

158
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:41,693
We... we have a commission cap?

159
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,260
It's a new corporate policy.

160
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:46,129
Dunh-duh-na-dah!

161
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:48,932
Is this job really about
the money for you, Jim?

162
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,801
I mean, isn't this
where you fell in love?

163
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,837
A commission cap takes away
my incentive to sell.

164
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:56,272
So you realize I now have
no reason to work, right?

165
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,208
When you're dealing
with a large organization,

166
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,544
sometimes you have to put up
with policies you don't like.

167
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,514
I wish my gym didn't allow full
nudity in the locker room.

168
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,750
Okay, some of these old guys
walking around naked

169
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,985
feels almost passive-aggressive.

170
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:12,553
But I deal with it.

171
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,054
'Cause it's policy.
See what I mean?

172
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:15,088
Nope.

173
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:16,656
- Nudity makes me uncomfortable.
- Okay.

174
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,724
My gym allows it.

175
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,226
I wish they didn't,
but it's policy.

176
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:22,628
So I respect it, and I just...

177
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:25,430
Keep a low... you know,
I look away.

178
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:27,499
Think about your commission cap

179
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:30,434
as a naked old man
in a gym locker room.

180
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:33,770
Excuse me, everyone.

181
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,038
Sex!

182
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:37,173
Now that I have
your attention...

183
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:38,774
You don't have our attention.

184
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:39,775
Money!

185
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:41,176
I'm listening.

186
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:42,277
You had me at "sex."

187
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:43,277
Pervert.

188
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:44,445
You have all of our attention

189
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:45,679
just by screaming anything.

190
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:46,780
That's good to know.

191
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:49,282
What do you want
to say, Michael?

192
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,784
WUPHF!

193
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:52,985
All right,
I've warmed them up for you.

194
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:54,053
You have the floor, Ryan.

195
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,889
- How's everybody doing?
- Whoo!

196
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:58,256
Good!

197
00:06:58,324 --> 00:06:59,491
Now, a lot of you have already
staked out

198
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:01,026
your corner of the WUPHF empire.

199
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,428
Raise your hand
if I'm describing you.

200
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:06,764
Great.

201
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,298
Yes, I have a dream.

202
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,935
And it's not some M.L.K. Dream
for equality.

203
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:16,538
I want to own
a decommissioned lighthouse.

204
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:18,573
And I want to live at the top.

205
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:21,309
And nobody knows I live there.

206
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:24,545
And there's a button
that I can press,

207
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:28,747
and it'll launch that lighthouse
into space.

208
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,881
For my current investors,

209
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,416
things are going great.

210
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,484
We already have a buyer.

211
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:33,484
Really? Who?

212
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:34,818
Washington university.

213
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:36,720
I don't even want
to think about selling

214
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:37,755
until our numbers
get into the billions.

215
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,256
At least.

216
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:42,259
So I've decided to open up
a second round of investment

217
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:44,560
to friends and family.

218
00:07:44,628 --> 00:07:46,927
Oh, God. Hold on to
your wallets, ladies.

219
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:47,927
Did you ever think of WUPHF

220
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:50,162
as an emergency notification
system,

221
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,331
like, for college campuses
with shooters or gas leaks?

222
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,134
No, no... Oscar, it's not...

223
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,537
It's not a digital rape whistle.

224
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:57,306
- WUPHF is about fun.
- That's right.

225
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:59,308
Fun, communication, connection.

226
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:00,909
What's your money situation?

227
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:03,011
- Well, it's tight,
as with any start-up.

228
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:05,112
Sure, how long can you sustain
this without a cash infusion?

229
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,714
We have nine solid days.

230
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:08,649
I love these questions.
Keep 'em coming.

231
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:10,617
I'm sorry,
nine days until what?

232
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:11,918
Bankruptcy?

233
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:14,686
Wait, Ryan, so this could be
over by the weekend?

234
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:16,688
How long do you think
a week is?

235
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:18,489
No, not this weekend;
Next weekend.

236
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:20,157
We were gonna go
on the investors ski trip.

237
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,194
I bought poles.

238
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,305
Well, since I have
no incentive to sell,

239
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,707
I've cleaned my car,
organized my desk,

240
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,009
and taken a multivitamin.

241
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,545
So...

242
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:35,679
What now?

243
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:39,045
Pam.

244
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:42,247
Okay, now I've tried everything.

245
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,414
Did you prank Dwight?

246
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,447
- No.
- Well, you like that.

247
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:47,848
Yeah, it's not as fun
if I'm not blowing off work.

248
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,616
I love you, but I'm kinda busy,

249
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:52,117
so I need you to figure this one
out on your own.

250
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,529
Oscar said WUPHF only has

251
00:09:03,597 --> 00:09:04,830
enough money for nine days.

252
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:06,064
Check this out.

253
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,568
- All that color.
- Look at that.

254
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:11,868
Triple your investment
by January.

255
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:14,201
Anyone can just throw numbers
up on a chart.

256
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:15,636
What are you doing
to make it happen?

257
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,337
Well, earlier today,
I was emailing

258
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,706
someone by the name of
John legend.

259
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,507
- There you go.
- You have his email?

260
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:22,108
A lot of these guys
are just Mac.Com,

261
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,809
@ their website whatever.

262
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:25,844
We get that guy wuphfing,

263
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:26,845
it's all over.

264
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:28,646
I want my money back.

265
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:29,980
Do not talk like that, Stanley.

266
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:32,148
Ryan, just tell us your plan.

267
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:33,682
Okay, all right.

268
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,850
I know what you wanna see.

269
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,418
I'll be right back.

270
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:44,459
Hey, kids, was that fun?

271
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:45,460
Yeah!

272
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:46,462
All right.

273
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,698
I wanna go on it again.

274
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,131
Oh, I bet you do.

275
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,132
You know what?

276
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,232
When I was a little kid,

277
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,500
they couldn't get me
off the hayride.

278
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:54,101
But it's gonna cost you
three more bucks.

279
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:57,269
Wow!
This brings back memories.

280
00:09:58,504 --> 00:10:00,939
Hay stacking, hay throwing...

281
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:02,140
And at the end of it all,

282
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:05,544
one lucky boy would be crowned
hay king.

283
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:07,845
I always wanted to be hay king.

284
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:11,013
The world shines on mose.

285
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:18,585
Where have you been?
I've been waiting.

286
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:20,087
Uh, can we move this
to the end of the day?

287
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:22,189
No, I... I think you should
make time for it.

288
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,656
I found the needle
in the haystack!

289
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,625
Hey, congratulations.
Do you know what your prize is?

290
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:26,893
I don't know.

291
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:30,597
Nothing. Life lesson?
Some tasks are not worth doing.

292
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:32,566
Dwight?

293
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:34,167
WUPHF t-shirts.

294
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:35,702
Who wants one?

295
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,970
Just imagine that you're
at spring break Daytona beach.

296
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:38,972
- Here we go.
- Okay?

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,407
Everyone's like, "hey dude,

298
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,943
what's up with all the hotties
in the WUPHF shirts?"

299
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:45,713
Or, uh, "hey, what's up
with that helicopter?"

300
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,380
"It's Ryan from WUPHF!"

301
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,449
- "It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!"
- "Yo, Ryan from WUPHF!"

302
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:51,084
- "He's up there."
- "What's he dropping?"

303
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,019
"Wow, what's falling on
us, man?"

304
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,387
WUPHF condoms!

305
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,222
50,000 condoms out of the sky.

306
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,656
Look at that!
He threw 'em on the ground!

307
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,225
Look, this is
a marketing campaign.

308
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,259
You got nine days.

309
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,293
Let's say you do get the money.

310
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,561
What are you going
to do with it?

311
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,496
The first lesson of silicon
valley, actually,

312
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,532
is that you only think
about the user, the experience.

313
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,133
You actually don't think
about the money.

314
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,134
Ever.

315
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,402
That sounds weird.

316
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,403
No, it's not weird, Andy,
and you know what else?

317
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,805
We have an offer
from Washington university.

318
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:19,473
So monetize that.

319
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,674
Are you guys meeting
about WUPHF?

320
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,810
You know that that
was my idea, right?

321
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:24,912
I said to Ryan,
"I try to call you,

322
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,181
"and you don't have your phone.

323
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:27,915
"I try to I.M. you,
and you're not online.

324
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:29,717
"I wish there was a way that I
could do everything all at once,

325
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:30,885
"and I could just be like this
little dog going,

326
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:32,252
'ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'"

327
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,388
- Baby, baby, baby...
- I think I'm gonna stay here.

328
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:35,622
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I do, I do.

329
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:37,056
This isn't right.

330
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:38,324
I help you with your things,
and you help me with my things.

331
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:39,658
But I... it's not right.

332
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:40,658
I got this, it's okay,

333
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:42,058
don't worry about this.

334
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:44,727
Is it any particular branch
of Washington university?

335
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:46,896
The Washington University
Public Health Fund.

336
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:50,099
W.U.P.H.F.

337
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,300
Oh, God.

338
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,768
They only want it
for the initials.

339
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,437
The domain name.
Yeah, they do.

340
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:55,571
I move we sell.

341
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,273
- What?
- Yeah, sell.

342
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,407
- Sell.
- Get us out of this.

343
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:00,075
Have some faith in this idea.

344
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:01,977
If everybody wants to sell,
we sell, right?

345
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:03,111
I won't sell.

346
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:04,212
And you know what?

347
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,647
Ryan and I have
the majority of shares.

348
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:07,781
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

349
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:08,782
You alone do, actually.

350
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:09,782
I... Yes.

351
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,116
We're not selling.

352
00:12:11,184 --> 00:12:13,084
I will not sell.

353
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:16,554
Awesome.

354
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,024
Do you mind if we
share this bale?

355
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:23,725
Sure.

356
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:25,960
There's no charge
to s on the hay, is there?

357
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,628
Probably.

358
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:29,329
I mean, wouldn't you think

359
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:31,163
the ten dollars
to build your own broom

360
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:32,764
would include the hay
and not just the instructions?

361
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,099
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, I'm starting to think

362
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,370
this guy is just trying to make
money off the holiday.

363
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:38,807
Yeah, instead of hay place
it should be pay place.

364
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:40,843
Don't laugh at me.

365
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,877
No, no, no, I wasn't...

366
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,780
I was just laughing
at your joke.

367
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:47,284
Oh.

368
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:48,886
- Pay place.
- Mm.

369
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:52,455
Yeah, so we can celebrate
Thanksgiving-me-your-money day.

370
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:54,824
That's humorous.

371
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:58,860
Thank you.

372
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,328
You guys know how to get out?

373
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,667
Hi, Michael.

374
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,567
Can't talk, saving the planet.

375
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:10,002
Oh, we don't recycle.

376
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,372
We don't?

377
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:12,740
Well, why have I been
separating the trash

378
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:13,941
into whites and colors?

379
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,710
I'm sure no one
asked you to do that.

380
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,681
Eight years.

381
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:23,150
Listen, I know
you really like Ryan...

382
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,918
No, I won't even consider it.

383
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:27,487
Michael, I...

384
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:30,524
I hate to say this, but...

385
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,593
You know this special bond

386
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,327
that you've always felt
with Ryan,

387
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:36,162
where, like, you're best friends

388
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,730
or you're his mentor
or something?

389
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:41,832
Right, yes, yeah.
Best friend/mentor.

390
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,034
Michael, I think that
that feeling only goes one way.

391
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:49,038
And I think
that Ryan knows that,

392
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,840
and he's taking advantage
of you.

393
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:55,144
I think you are wrong.

394
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,847
And there are a lot
of other people in this office

395
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:00,216
who have money at stake.

396
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:01,550
Other people you care about.

397
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:08,390
You may be right.

398
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:10,391
I may be crazy.

399
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,859
Don't.

400
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:14,562
I'm just saying that I think
I agree with your point.

401
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,731
Yeah, but in a jokey way where
you're gonna start singing.

402
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,167
I thought it might make me
feel better.

403
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,102
Okay.

404
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,270
Go ahead.

405
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,174
♪ But it just may be
a lunatic... ♪

406
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:31,742
No.

407
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,882
Ooh, nice, wasting time,
here we go.

408
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:39,017
Hey, back off.
It's solitaire.

409
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:40,852
Hey, kid...

410
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,853
Hear you're looking for work.

411
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:42,854
Talk to me.

412
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:43,854
How far can you reach

413
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:45,355
those lovely long ms of yours?

414
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:47,824
Eh, put 'em down.

415
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,091
How long

416
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,226
can you hold that pretty little
breath of yours?

417
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:54,830
Good.

418
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:56,431
Hey, Jim?

419
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:57,932
Are you distracting
these people?

420
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,901
We're working.

421
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,702
<i>Can you at least
try to look busy?</i>

422
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,604
The moment Darla put
the cupcake in her mouth,

423
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,973
her daddy pulled her aside
and said,

424
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,240
"you're too fat.

425
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,876
No one's gonna like you
if you're too fat."

426
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:17,314
The next time I saw David Gaffen
was at the Buffalo Club.

427
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:20,384
Love you, you gay bastard,"
I said

428
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,819
"you gay bastard," I s...

429
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,454
"gay ba..."

430
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,422
"gay b..."

431
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,060
Michael, how's it going, bro?

432
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:33,394
Good, good, bro.

433
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:34,995
Hey, thanks so much for having
my back out there.

434
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:36,596
Always have your back.

435
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:39,599
So any ideas on how we can go
over this nine-day hump here?

436
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,833
I have nothing but ideas

437
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:43,301
the thing is,
they all require money.

438
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:45,937
Nine days, though.
That's, like...

439
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:47,605
Look, I know I've tapped you
so hard.

440
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:49,607
Yes, you have tapped this.
Hard.

441
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,576
Oh, you are funny, Michael.

442
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:54,611
You... people... people don't give
you enough credit.

443
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:57,246
Maybe I could take a second
mortgage on my condo.

444
00:15:57,314 --> 00:15:58,714
Well, a lot of people
are doing at.

445
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:00,416
And there don't seem to be
any consequences.

446
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:02,384
And they say the rates
have never been lower.

447
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:05,787
So you would think
that's a good idea for me to do?

448
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,188
Think about this:

449
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:09,790
You and me on a private plane

450
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:12,258
- flown by our private pilot...
- Mm-hmm.

451
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:14,994
Eating our private meal cooked
by our private chef.

452
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:17,429
Yeah, well, we never even have
dinner now, so...

453
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:18,430
We totally should.

454
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:19,431
Tonight?

455
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:20,899
I gotta work on this.

456
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:22,600
Oh, right.
What am I saying?

457
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:23,601
Rain check.

458
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:24,668
Yeah.

459
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:30,340
And now, by show of applause,

460
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,642
we will crown this year's
hay king.

461
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,911
All in favor of purebred.

462
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:37,813
Put your hands together for...

463
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:38,814
Mixed bread.

464
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:41,816
And let's hear it for...

465
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:42,817
Purebred.

466
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,318
Mm.

467
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:47,253
It would appear weave
a three-way tie.

468
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,356
I have no choice but to pick
the hay king myself.

469
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:54,193
I pick...

470
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,661
Me!

471
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:57,329
I am your hay king!

472
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:00,731
All hail your hay king!

473
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,637
D I truck 300 les of hay

474
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:10,608
to a parking l to rectify
some childhood disappointment?

475
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,042
Yes.

476
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,610
So if I were
to call Dunder Mifflin

477
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:15,712
and ask for miss Angela Martin,

478
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:18,447
would I get through to you?

479
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:21,182
You would.

480
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,718
And if I were to call your house
and ask for your wife,

481
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:24,820
would I get through to you?

482
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:27,956
My wife passed away
a few years ago.

483
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:29,891
How tragic.

484
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,258
Very sorry to hear that.

485
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:33,794
Thank you.

486
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,096
Help!

487
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:38,799
Hello?

488
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:42,569
Oh!
Help!

489
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,707
Consider it a WUPHF in person.

490
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,108
You're doing the wrong thing.

491
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:50,376
You're gonna lose
Michael's investment,

492
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,677
you're gonna lose ours.

493
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:54,213
You got this crazy opportunity
to get our money back.

494
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,781
Tell Mike to sell.

495
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:57,715
If you tell Michael to sell,
he'll sell.

496
00:17:57,783 --> 00:17:59,983
I'm betting on myself.

497
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,584
It's a bad bet.

498
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:02,584
Hello.

499
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:04,753
Hey.
It's an ambush here.

500
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,087
Nobody here believes
in this company.

501
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:07,421
Will you tell them
they're wrong?

502
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:08,956
It's not that we don't believe
in the company.

503
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:10,024
We don't believe in you.

504
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:11,826
All those in favor of selling,
say aye.

505
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:12,827
- Aye.
- Aye.

506
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:15,062
- Aye.
- Aye.

507
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,530
Aye.

508
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,833
Do not agree to sell,
which is to say nay.

509
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,501
What is wrong with you?

510
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,237
What happened to you
in high school?

511
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,672
Michael, are you that blind?

512
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,772
I'm not blind!

513
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,741
I know exactly who he is.

514
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,943
He is selfish and lazy
and image-obsessed,

515
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,045
and he is a bad friend.

516
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:38,047
And he's also clever.

517
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:40,315
And he shoots incredibly high.

518
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:42,250
And he may just make it.

519
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:44,018
But you know what,
even if he doesn't,

520
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:47,254
I would rather go broke
betting on my people

521
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:49,290
than get rich all by myself

522
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,325
on some island like a castaway.

523
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:53,227
And there is no middle ground.

524
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:55,263
You're gonna lose
all of our money.

525
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,797
Only if he fails.

526
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:58,466
And you know what?

527
00:18:58,534 --> 00:18:59,801
Ryan, I believe in you.

528
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:03,769
Just like I believe
in all of you.

529
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:06,870
You have nine days to save
everybody's money.

530
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,270
Oh...

531
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:09,637
That's a lot of pressure.

532
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:11,639
I... I'm gonna need
some more time.

533
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:12,974
You can't have it.

534
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,211
Okay.

535
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:19,279
I won't let you down.

536
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:29,422
Angela?

537
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:31,023
Angela!

538
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:43,300
The world sends people
your way...

539
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,535
Ryan came to me
through a temp agency.

540
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:48,704
Andy was transferred here.

541
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,539
No idea where creed came from.

542
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,040
The point is

543
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,343
you just have to play with
the cards that you're dealt.

544
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,912
Jim, that guy is an ace.

545
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,647
Dwight is my king up my sleeve.

546
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:01,015
Phyllis is my old maid.

547
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:02,349
Oscar is my queen.

548
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,484
That's easy.

549
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:04,752
Gimme a hard one.

550
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:06,820
That's what Oscar said.

551
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:09,589
Toby is the instruction card
you throw away.

552
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:11,424
Pam's a solid seven.

553
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:12,425
And yeah, you know what?

554
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:14,159
Ryan is probably, like, a two.

555
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:16,227
But sometimes twos can be wild.

556
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:17,461
So watch out.

557
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,197
And I am obviously the joker.

558
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:22,666
So...

559
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,234
That's, uh...

560
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:27,703
WUPHF from Ryan Howard.

561
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:29,437
Decided to sell company.

562
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:31,940
Thanks, bro.
Hell of a ride.

563
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,476
Thank God.

565
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:44,475
Gabe Lewis.

566
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:47,441
Now, listen here, Gabe,
you're too fat.

567
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,390
No one's gonna like you
if you're too fat.

568
00:20:49,744 --> 00:20:51,574
I made some changes to my book.

569
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,508
- See if you like them.
- Well, Jo...

570
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,127
Now I am breaking.
I hate being interrupted.

571
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:58,623
Shut up and listen,
gay bastard.

572
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:01,125
Chapter 1: I was born...

573
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:04,562
Not into luxury or poverty,
but into adversity.

574
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:07,397
And for that I thank the Lord.
My father was a man.

575
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,552
That is all we need to know.

576
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:10,639
After I learned to ride the bike,
there was no stopping.

577
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:14,450
I would ride up Magnolia St.
and down Azalea Lane.

578
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,786
Which would later become my favorite....

579
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:18,191
All right, good night, Gabe.
I just wanted to say thanks again.

580
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,768
Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.

581
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:23,579
I have always been a fighter...

582
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,872
And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles.

583
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,210
The first being a hard...
