1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:03,532
So, I'm happy to be here.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,363
It's very nice
to see all of you.

3
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:07,798
You're all looking well.

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,342
Today is a "women
in the workplace" thing.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,971
Jan's coming in from Corporate
to talk to all the women about...

6
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,307
I don't really know what.

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,945
But Michael's not allowed in.
She said that about five times.

8
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:24,612
Women today, though we have
the same options as men,

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,956
we often face a very
different set of obstacles

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,893
In getting there. So...

11
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,157
Hey, what's going on?
Michael...

12
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,324
Yeah, you know what? I thought
we agreed you wouldn't be here.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,528
I thought about it. I just
have a few things I want to say.

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,003
What are you doing?
Just hear me out.

15
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,267
What is more important
than quality?

16
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,598
Equality.

17
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:47,408
Now, studies show that today's woman,
the Ally McBeal Woman, as I call her,

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,606
is at a crossroads.

19
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,842
Michael...
And... No, just...

20
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,646
You have come a long way,
baby.

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,313
But I just want to keep
it within reason. Michael.

22
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,879
They did this up in Albany... You
are not allowed in this session, okay?

23
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,049
...and they ended up turning

24
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,252
the break room into a lactation
room, which is disgusting.

25
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,919
Now you're really not
allowed in this session.

26
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,464
Well, I'm their boss.
I am your boss.

27
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,936
Anybody want any coffee or
anything? We're fine, Michael.

28
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,405
We just need you to leave,
please.

29
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,101
Women
in the workplace.

30
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,137
Yeah. Translation, I have been
banned from my own conference room

31
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,305
so that Jan can talk in
secret to all the girls.

32
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,748
Whoa, sorry.
Women of the workplace.

33
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,080
About what? I don't know.

34
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,949
Clothes. Me.

35
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,617
Ladies, I am so, so sorry.

36
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,187
Can we start again?
We were on such a roll.

37
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,354
I really apologize...
Jan?

38
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,954
...for that. Yes, Pam?

39
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,430
Michael's still at the door. Michael!

40
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,398
So, one obstacle

41
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,801
is how assertiveness is perceived
differently in men and women.

42
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,171
Men who are assertive tend to
be admired. They're called...

43
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,198
Anyone?

44
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,473
That's a terrible idea.

45
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:27,972
What is?

46
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,911
Them in there all together.

47
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,610
They stay in there too long,
they're gonna get on the same cycle.

48
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,121
Wreak havoc on our plumbing.

49
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,089
Everyone? Guys?
Circle up, please.

50
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,790
Come on over.
Bring your chairs.

51
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,727
Toby? Come on over.

52
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,925
You're a guy, too. Sort of.

53
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,061
Let's do this!

54
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:54,569
Well, first of all, I just want to
warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.

55
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,334
Let's just clap. Ready?

56
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,802
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

57
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,870
Okay, I don't know what you're
doing here, Michael...

58
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,939
Just having a little
"guys in the workplace" thing.

59
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,078
...but it's very disruptive.
Why can't boys play with dolls?

60
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,386
Why does society

61
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,721
force us to use urinals,

62
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,226
when sitting down
is far more comfortable?

63
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,887
Can you please do this
somewhere else, Michael?

64
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,022
We have nowhere else, Jan.

65
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,464
This... We could do it in the warehouse.

66
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,195
Dwight. Excellent idea.
Go to the warehouse.

67
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,033
Okay, fine.
Actually, perfect. Perfect.

68
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:30,371
You know what? There is another
side to this place, gentlemen.

69
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:34,243
And I know we all love our cushy
jobs and our fun, exciting office,

70
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,441
but do you realize
that underneath us,

71
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,847
there's another world?

72
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,350
The warehouse world.

73
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,879
A world that is teeming with
sweat and dirt and life.

74
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,351
Life.

75
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,490
The bowels of the office.

76
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,554
These guys are down there, they
are real men, doing real men's work.

77
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,795
We are going to learn
how a warehouse works.

78
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,668
I think
this is gonna work out great.

79
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,504
Because managing the warehouse is
a very important part of my job,

80
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,738
and I haven't been there
in months.

81
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,464
Remember on Lost
when they met The Others?

82
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,909
I am so sorry about that.

83
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,005
So, where were we? Pam, are
you okay taking notes, then?

84
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,708
Please?
Yeah.

85
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,182
Thank you very much.

86
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,912
So, let's meet the warehouse!

87
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,783
Let's get some shots.

88
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,217
Pan around there.

89
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,693
This is Darryl.
One of our warehouse staff.

90
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,259
Darryl,
what is your biggest fear?

91
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,355
My biggest fear is that
someone will distract us

92
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,593
from getting all the shipments
out on time. You know what?

93
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,399
Darryl is actually the foreman
here, and not Roy, which is cool.

94
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,439
There's Roy,
riding the big rig.

95
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:11,307
So, Roy is actually going to be
marrying Pam sometime this summer.

96
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,870
And she's our receptionist.

97
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,777
Sort of a "Brangelina" thing.

98
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,008
Why?

99
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,483
"Brangelina" is the Brad Pitt
and Angelina. I don't understand.

100
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,785
Roy... Roy and Pam. It's a
"Ram. " It's a "Ram" thing.

101
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,519
I bet Roy heard about you
liking Pam.

102
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,788
I bet he'll try
to beat you up.

103
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,097
Thanks for the heads up, Kev.

104
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,267
I got your back, if he does.

105
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,600
But try to stay out of it.

106
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,765
Just in case there's somebody
down here who shouldn't be.

107
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,038
A little Good Will Hunting
situation.

108
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,602
All right. Troops.

109
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,074
This is an important day,
a big day.

110
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,680
Now, you may look around

111
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,551
and see two groups here.

112
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,957
White collar, blue collar.

113
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,653
But I don't see it that way.
And you know why not?

114
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,990
Because I am collar-blind.

115
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,198
Why don't we go around the table and all
say something that we know we're good at?

116
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,863
I will start.
I am good at public speaking.

117
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,702
Hi. I'm Meredith,
and I'm an...

118
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,871
Good at supplier relations.

119
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,343
Great! Phyllis?

120
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,375
I'm good at computer stuff.

121
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,314
E- mails, spreadsheets.
All that.

122
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,442
Really?

123
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,012
I don't know.
I thought that...

124
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,519
No. Okay. Stop.

125
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,850
You know, I've seen
some of your spreadsheets,

126
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,015
and I almost always... Really?
I thought they were pretty...

127
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,117
I don't know how
I fit in with these women

128
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,094
here, or with Jan.

129
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,732
I mean, we get along great.
Fine.

130
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,596
I guess the person I have
the most in common with is...

131
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,140
Jim Halpert!

132
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,740
Hey, I, you know,

133
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,644
heard there's a rumor going around about
you used to have a crush on Pam and...

134
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,342
Oh, no, no.
No, no, it's cool,

135
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,975
'cause I know
you're a good guy,

136
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,246
and I know that that crush
ended a long time ago.

137
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,754
So, you know, we're cool.
All right?

138
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,519
Yeah. No, yeah. Definitely.

139
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,083
You know, it's great with me.
'Cause that way...

140
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,357
I'm glad she has a friend at work
she can get through the day with.

141
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,422
Oh. And then she's not
all "bap, bap, bap, bap,"

142
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,831
you know, when she gets home.
Yeah. I like talking to her, too.

143
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,633
So, we're cool, right?
Yes. Yeah.

144
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,372
Yup. Cool, man.
Good. All right. Sweet.

145
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,774
Hey, Mike, look.
How about we go upstairs, too?

146
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,116
You know, learn how an
office works. Oh, well.

147
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,554
We can both switch places
for the day. Okay. Yeah.

148
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,091
You know what? I don't...
You... Your...

149
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,558
My job sucks compared to this.

150
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,060
I don't think you'd like it
up there. An experience...

151
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,359
Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?

152
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,061
Okay. Let's go.

153
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,728
Step up.

154
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,202
Check this out.

155
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,000
Look at that. Look at that.

156
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,632
Hello, how are... Okay.

157
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,572
That's great.
That is good stuff.

158
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,511
In five years, I'd like
to be five years sober.

159
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,749
That is an excellent goal.

160
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,321
Four and a half.

161
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,715
I'll tell you one thing.

162
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,660
I am not gonna be one of those women
schlepping her kids around in a minivan.

163
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,787
Great.

164
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,128
I want an SUV
with three rows of seats.

165
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,424
That would be great.

166
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,491
I'll be honest.

167
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,868
One of the goals of these women's seminars
is to feel out if there's any standouts,

168
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,874
women who could be a valuable
addition to our corporate life.

169
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,613
Michael wants us to bond, so
we need topics for conversation.

170
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,672
Ponies.

171
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,775
No.

172
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,876
How about rainbows?

173
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,113
No.

174
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,678
Flowers.
No!

175
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,481
That's dangerous, Mike. Come
on, get down off the lift.

176
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,025
Hey, you're gonna hurt yourself. Mike!

177
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,288
Stand clear. Mike, get
off of the lift. Please!

178
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,262
Come on, now. I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

179
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,426
Look, would you...
Look...

180
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,701
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

181
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,174
We're the ones
that gotta clean that up!

182
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,205
Damn it, Michael!

183
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,941
We have
to have this thing serviced.

184
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,177
So, guys' gripe session.

185
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,610
Here we are.

186
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,383
Now, we definitely live
in different worlds,

187
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,721
but we have a lot in common.

188
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,084
We even like the same girls,
some of us.

189
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,530
And that's gonna happen.
You know, we're guys, so...

190
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,761
Hey, do you want me to go?

191
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,099
No, why would I? You can...

192
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,533
I'll go.
... stay, or...

193
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,067
And a big walk-in closet.

194
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,874
Oh, that's part of my
dream, too. Oh, me, too.

195
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,480
Great. Great.

196
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,012
And, Pam? What about you?
What is your dream?

197
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:50,888
Well, I always dreamed of a
house with a terrace upstairs.

198
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,590
Plant flowers on it, stuff
like that. Since I was a girl.

199
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,656
More seriously, though,

200
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,623
a husband that I love.

201
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,958
Roy.

202
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,903
And I love to draw.

203
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,873
And I did a little in college,
and I'd still love to do something

204
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,205
where I could work with art
or graphic design in some way.

205
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,744
She's real good.
Thanks.

206
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,714
You know, the company is offering a
design training program in New York.

207
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,511
Well, I have a job right now.

208
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,553
So, I can't really take time
off. Well, it's only on weekends.

209
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,589
And then a few weeks
in New York,

210
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,386
but I'm sure that I could ask
Corporate to help you out.

211
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,450
Well, it's just that the
weekends aren't good because...

212
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,587
There are always a million
reasons not to do something.

213
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,233
Let's start
with the warehouse.

214
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,737
What bothers you as guys?
You know?

215
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,329
My priority is safety.

216
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,396
Okay.

217
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,467
So it really bothers me when somebody
comes in here, speeding around on the lift,

218
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,637
playing with it like a toy.
It kind of gets under my skin.

219
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,305
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,141
Don't shush me.

221
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,014
No, that was just...
That bothers me, too.

222
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,144
I was breathing. Pam shushes
me. It drives me crazy.

223
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,212
I hate shushing.
You know, that's the thing.

224
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,419
What... Okay. What is
our beef, as human men?

225
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,290
You know, that's
a good question, Hasselhoff.

226
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,667
Okay. All right.
What bugs us?

227
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,929
Good.
Guys ragging on each other.

228
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,870
That's what guys do,
and we love it.

229
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,406
All right.
Let's talk about clothing.

230
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,179
I'm excited about today.
I love girl talk.

231
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,981
Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have.

232
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,485
All right, you can use your clothing
to send a message about your ambitions

233
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,081
by wearing clothes that
reflect what you aspire to be.

234
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,217
I'm not gaining anything
from this seminar.

235
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,227
I'm a professional woman,

236
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,728
the head of Accounting.

237
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,357
I'm in the healthiest
relationship of my life.

238
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,596
I just think it's insulting
that Jan thinks we need this.

239
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,270
And apparently,
judging from her outfit,

240
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,569
Jan aspires to be a whore.

241
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,908
I hate it when girls insist on
taking them out to new restaurants

242
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,105
every weekend night,

243
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,843
and then they're like, "When
are we gonna go on a date-date?"

244
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,181
I hate that, too!
I hate that, too!

245
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,981
That sucks so hard.
It totally sucks!

246
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,545
Yeah, and then they make you drive
them to church the next morning.

247
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,988
Like, gas ain't free.

248
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,325
Yeah, on our salaries, man.
What do they expect?

249
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,261
You know, "Take us out every
weekend," you know what I mean?

250
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,821
I feel you, man.
We're not millionaires.

251
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,629
I feel you. No, you
don't. You don't feel us.

252
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,897
How can you? You know what?
Not literally.

253
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,029
You say we're the same,

254
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,267
but we get compensated
very differently. Yes.

255
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,333
We work the same hours as you, and
you just said we work a lot harder.

256
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,312
You do. So...
But we get paid a lot less.

257
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,506
Word.

258
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,573
Like, next to no benefits.
I know.

259
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,379
God, what is that?
Exactly.

260
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,079
It blows. It blows, man!

261
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,748
You know, this would not
happen if we had a union.

262
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,256
That's what I'm talking about.

263
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,589
Absolutely, that's what we
need to do. You're right.

264
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,855
See, that's what I've been
saying, man.

265
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,123
We need to do this, finally.

266
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,562
You know what,
is that necessary?

267
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,328
'Cause you already, sort of,
have a union of guys.

268
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,165
It's more than necessary,
Mike. We need this.

269
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,296
Roy?
Yeah?

270
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,237
Do you still have that card
from the dockworkers' union?

271
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,138
Dockworkers?
In my truck.

272
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,301
Come on, man.
Yeah.

273
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,870
You know what? I think
our problem is the chicks.

274
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,710
The problem is the chicks.
Union! Yeah!

275
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,879
And you gotta blame them.

276
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,754
Are you with us, Mike?
Yeah...

277
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,485
Welcome to the warehouse.

278
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:17,222
Michael! Michael!
Michael! Michael!

279
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,161
Another issue is inequality
of pay between men and women.

280
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,129
I'm sure that all of you
have dealt with that before.

281
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,729
This is important.
Ladies, take a breather.

282
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,001
Jan, I

283
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,070
wanted...

284
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,444
Can I help you?

285
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,445
I wanted to say that the guys downstairs
are thinking about forming a union,

286
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,020
and they have some good
points. What? A union?

287
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,247
Don't get hysterical.
I'm not.

288
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,189
Part of my job is knowing
how to talk to women.

289
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,919
Let's be rational here.

290
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,294
What are the pros?
What are the cons?

291
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,389
The cons are that everyone will
lose their job, Michael. Everyone.

292
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,400
Office, warehouse...

293
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,633
What do you think
the pros are here?

294
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,937
Don't talk to me that way,
please. Just...

295
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,072
They're gonna want
to hear this from you.

296
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,442
You got yourself into this,
Michael, so...

297
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,209
We're bonding down there.... you get
yourself out of it. That's too bad.

298
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,615
I just don't want to have to tell them
something they're not gonna want to hear.

299
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,119
Now who's getting hysterical?
Okay. Come on, Jan.

300
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,348
After all we've been
through... Michael, Michael...

301
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,789
We have a history.
We have a history between us.

302
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,020
Michael.
Don't say another word.

303
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,187
Get yourself downstairs.

304
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,562
I'm just saying that we have
something. Okay. Whatever.

305
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,698
You know what?

306
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,072
We could get this done a lot quicker
if we formed a type of assembly line.

307
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,769
This here is a "run out
the clock" situation.

308
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,938
Just like upstairs.

309
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,810
Sports metaphors
are one of the ways

310
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,783
women feel left out
of the language of the office.

311
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,810
Now, I know this might sound silly,
but many women ask to go over it, so,

312
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,254
"fumble" means...

313
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,381
Mistake.
Slip.

314
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,447
Right.

315
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,983
"Par for the course" is a golf
term. It means "right on track. "

316
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,057
"Below par" means "worse. "

317
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,597
Wait. That should mean better.
That doesn't make sense.

318
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,226
What about "second base"?

319
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,761
Like, if Michael said he
got to second base with you,

320
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,536
does that mean you, like,
closed a deal? Excuse me?

321
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,509
I mean,
that's a baseball term, right?

322
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,378
I don't know what Michael was
talking about. I don't know.

323
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,440
Like, you went to Chili's, and
he got to second base with you.

324
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,641
Excuse me.

325
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,710
Kelly, I don't know what
Michael was talking about.

326
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,619
He just told everybody, and I
just want to know if that's...

327
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,715
Hey.
Hey.

328
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,420
How's it going down there?

329
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,260
It's a complete... Well, actually,
it's exactly what you'd expect, so...

330
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,889
How are the girls?
Good.

331
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,560
We watched a video
about our changing bodies.

332
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,235
Did you really?
No.

333
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,499
Oh.
Almost.

334
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,933
But, hey,
something kind of cool,

335
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,842
there's this internship in graphic
design that Jan was telling us about.

336
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,245
She made it sound, like,
really great.

337
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,947
Nice! Well, what's it all
about? I think you should do it.

338
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,620
That's great!
It's really cool.

339
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,357
Cold front
coming into the warehouse!

340
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,862
Better put on your ski boots!

341
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,698
Happy New Year, Darryl.

342
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,267
Hey, Darryl.

343
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,542
You ever done this?

344
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,407
Are you married?

345
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,947
I'm divorced.

346
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,380
That must have been hard.

347
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,474
It was, yes.

348
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,076
You were probably feeling
really depressed and sad,

349
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,587
and that's why you did that
thing with Michael.

350
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,625
I think you should all spend a little
more time thinking about your careers,

351
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,182
and less time
on personal stuff.

352
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,854
I think we're all okay
with the balance we've struck.

353
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,363
At least
you don't have kids.

354
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,262
You have no kids, right?
Thank God.

355
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,302
Okay. Let's take five.
I think we could all use five.

356
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,001
How can someone
so beautiful be so sad?

357
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,736
Hi. Did you take care of the situation?

358
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:58,271
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I have...

359
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,009
Excuse me. Excuse me....
essentially, yes, I have taken...

360
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,987
I'm told that there has been
some interest in forming a union,

361
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,683
and that Michael supported it.

362
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,316
Obviously,
he's not a friend of yours,

363
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,918
because he didn't tell you the
facts. So, let me.

364
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,793
If there is even a whiff
of unionizing in this branch,

365
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,663
I can guarantee you the branch
will be shut down like that.

366
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,862
They unionized in Pittsfield, and we
all know what happened in Pittsfield.

367
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,600
It will cost each of you a fortune
in legal fees and union dues,

368
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,234
and that will be nothing compared
to the cost of losing your jobs.

369
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,076
So I would think long and hard before
sacrificing your savings and your futures

370
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,048
just to send a message.

371
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,916
If you have any further questions,
you can direct them to...

372
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,022
To Michael.

373
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:45,226
Dreams are just that. They're dreams.
They help get you through the day.

374
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,399
Like the thing about the
terrace. It's nice,

375
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,594
but, I don't know,

376
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,194
it was just something I read
in this book when I was 12.

377
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:57,072
The girl in the book has a
terrace outside of her bedroom,

378
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,474
and she planted flowers on it,

379
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,713
and I just loved that.

380
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,872
It just always kind of
stuck with me.

381
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,644
So, you're not doing it.

382
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,217
How did you know?

383
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,982
Why not?

384
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,551
It's just, like...
No big reason.

385
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,226
Just a bunch of little reasons. Come on.

386
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,632
Roy's right. There's no guarantee
it's gonna lead to anything, anyway.

387
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,064
Roy said that?

388
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,960
What? You have something
you want to say?

389
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,432
You gotta take a chance on
something, sometime, Pam.

390
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,006
I mean, do you want to be
a receptionist here, always?

391
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,242
Oh, excuse me,
I'm fine with my choices.

392
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,209
You are?

393
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,084
Yeah.

394
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,318
It's impractical.

395
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,755
I'm not gonna try
to get a house like that.

396
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,854
They don't even make houses
like that in Scranton.

397
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,862
So, I'm never gonna...

398
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,965
I'm just gonna put this
over there.

399
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,103
This is not a good idea,
right here.

400
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,269
Easy does it. Okay.

401
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,283
Pizza. Great equalizer.

402
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,054
Rich people love pizza.
Poor people love pizza.

403
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,925
White people love pizza.
Black people love pizza.

404
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,528
Do black people like pizza?

405
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,607
Hey.

406
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,941
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

407
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,741
Sometimes Jan
can be such a bitch.

408
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,948
Yeah.
Yeah.

409
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,051
Hey, watch it. Watch it.

410
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,613
We have a relationship.

411
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,318
Thank you to our hosts.

412
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,853
Hey, Michael!

413
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,793
This ain't over.

414
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,629
Excellent.

415
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,869
Is it good to be back? Yeah.
I mean, I love the guy stuff,

416
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,639
but to run an office,
you need men and women.

417
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,906
You know why?

418
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,379
Because you need to have
that crazy sexual tension

419
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,247
to keep things interesting.

420
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,027
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

421
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,299
Hold, please.

422
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:45,272
Snow angels. Snow angels.
