1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:08,674
JOSH: The Stamford branch is closing,
and everybody's just packing up their stuff.

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,709
Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.

3
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,547
That's the other thing
you have to watch out... Yo, Tuna.

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,015
I wanna talk to you about this new boss,
Michael Scott.

5
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,883
Yeah?
So what's he like?

6
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:26,722
Likes, dislikes, favorite sports,
favorite movies, favorite men's magazines.

7
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,318
You know what?
I think you just need to meet him.

8
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,126
Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it.

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,567
Good luck over there, Tuna.
Cross me and I will destroy you.

10
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,532
Sounds good, Andy.

11
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:44,840
This is gonna be an adventure.
Yes, this is going to be very interesting.

12
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,242
All right, I'm out of here.

13
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,406
See you later?
Bro.

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,615
Hey, is that Josh's computer?
What?

15
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,090
PAM: <i>Hey!</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

16
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,758
How'd the run go?
Pretty good. I finished.

17
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,664
That's great.
Yes.

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,134
Why is that great?

19
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,761
Because he accomplished something.

20
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,669
What was your mile time?

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,367
About seven.

22
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,741
I could beat that on a skateboard.
Well, that has wheels.

23
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,280
Yeah, well, my feet don't,
and I can still crush that time.

24
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,315
Really, Dwight? How fast are you?

25
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,680
Let's just put it this way.

26
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,515
Last weekend,
I outran a black pepper snake.

27
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,679
Really?

28
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,017
I am fast.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,284
To give you a reference point,

30
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,292
I'm somewhere between
a snake and a mongoose.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,055
And a panther.

32
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,188
Man, what is taking Toby so long?

33
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,129
Oh, I'll just time him later.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,862
And you'll compare the times?
Yeah.

35
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,429
Are you ready? Set, <i>go!</i>
No, my groin's really tight, I can't...

36
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,205
Am I being mean to Dwight?

37
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,649
I don't know.
I did just make him run around the building,

38
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,082
and I have no intention of timing him.

39
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,679
This isn't even a stopwatch.
It's a digital thermometer.

40
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,818
He does make my life harder sometimes,
and on purpose.

41
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,088
Like, he tried to put meters
on the bathroom stalls

42
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,221
as a way of bringing in
more money for the company.

43
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,593
Hey, three more laps to <i>go!</i>

44
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,428
You gotta pick it up
if you're gonna beat <i>Toby!</i>

45
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,903
(GRUNTING)

46
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,274
I should probably get back to work.

47
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,604
Here. Who's here?
Nametag?

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,341
Yes, please.
Karen Filippelli.

49
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,541
Karen...

50
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,608
Karen <i>a-Filippelli!</i>
Probably Italian.

51
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,213
Possibly Filipina.
Okay...

52
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,951
My branch is absorbing
the Stamford branch.

53
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,428
Or as I like to put it,
my family is doubling in size.

54
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,793
And that's all
I'm gonna say about it,

55
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,425
because I have a gigantic performance
ahead of me,

56
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,937
and I have to get into my head and focus.

57
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,964
Who's next?
That's Andy Bernard.

58
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,600
Andy Bernard.

59
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,508
If I were you...
St. Bernard.

60
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,207
...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
What?

61
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,543
...before noon...
I'm not...

62
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,084
...to consolidate power.
I'm not firing somebody on the first day.

63
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,120
No, no, not somebody. <i>Gardner!</i>

64
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,280
The Japanese camp guards of World War II

65
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:47,725
always chose one man to kill
whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived.

66
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,696
I always wondered how they chose
the man who was to die.

67
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,927
I think I would have been good
at choosing the person.

68
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,498
Good <i>morning!</i>
Got the food, <i>good!</i>

69
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,007
Looky, looky, looky. What I want you to do...

70
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,577
Set it up in the conference room, please.
Make it look nice,

71
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:06,838
as if you were trying to impress

72
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,380
a much older man
who's way out of your league.

73
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,540
Okay.

74
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:16,886
Yes, I'm in a good mood today.
I'm excited to meet all of the new people

75
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,554
and to see my old friend again, definitely.

76
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,788
That's always a thing
that makes people happy,

77
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,454
to have an old friend back.

78
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,455
HANNAH: Hello?

79
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,932
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
Our first arrival.

80
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,469
Welcome to Scranton.

81
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:34,734
This is Hannah <i>Smoterich-Barr!</i>
Hannah <i>Smoterich-Barr!</i>

82
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:39,005
Welcome to our humble abode.
Follow me to your desk.

83
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,576
Your ball-and-chain is right over here.

84
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,785
You know, a lot of these people,
this is the only family they have.

85
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:51,415
So, as far as I'm concerned,
this says, "World's Best Dad."

86
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,524
There he <i>is!</i>

87
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,495
Tony... What's your last name?
Gardner.

88
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,394
<i>Gardner!</i> I knew that.

89
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,731
There you go, gift bag for you. <i>Okay!</i>
Thanks.

90
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,634
Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.

91
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,967
Well, they're just for guests.

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,667
If there are any left over,
you can buy one later.

93
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,072
My bag's mostly pencils.

94
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,409
Well, and coupons to various hot spots
around Scranton. All <i>right!</i>

95
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,005
Let me show you to your area, sir.

96
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,709
MICHAEL: Come on, big guy.

97
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,276
Can I have your pencils?
No.

98
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,514
<i>Hi!</i>
Hi.

99
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,148
I'm Pam.
Karen. I love your sweater.

100
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,454
Oh, thanks. My mom made it for me.

101
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,052
Really? That's so cool.
I've always wanted to learn

102
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,030
how to knit.
Welcome, welcome, <i>welcome!</i>

103
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:38,333
Take me to your leader.
Oh, wait, I am your leader.

104
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,666
Wait, are you a robot or a Martian?

105
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,305
I am actually your boss, Michael Scott.

106
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,405
Hi.
Welcome.

107
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,248
Wow, you are very exotic-Iooking.
Was your dad a GI, or...

108
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,227
<i>I'll be the number-two guy here in Scranton</i>
<i>in six weeks.</i>

109
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,462
How?
Name repetition, personality mirroring,

110
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,026
and never breaking off a handshake.

111
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,272
I'm always thinking one step ahead,

112
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,709
like a carpenter that makes stairs.

113
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,841
ANDY: Hello.

114
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,883
You must be Andy Bernard.
Aloha and <i>welcome!</i>

115
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:32,717
And you must be Michael Scott.
Aloha and hello.

116
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:38,220
Very good. Welcome to our little kingdom.

117
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,731
We have a bag of nifty gifties for you.

118
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:46,896
Well, Michael, thank you for welcoming me
to your little kingdom. Mike.

119
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,935
<i>Nifty!</i>
They are <i>nifty!</i>

120
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,944
They're nifty gifties.

121
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,503
You know who I really like
is this guy Andy Bernard.

122
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,573
He has got this very likeable way about him.

123
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,085
...which is why they need a passing game.
Right?

124
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,855
No <i>way!</i> Get him out of here.
We don't want any of this kind in here.

125
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,361
Good to see you, <i>man!</i>
Wow, <i>okay!</i>

126
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,864
How are you? Martin Nash, I presume?

127
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,593
This is a little gift bag for you
free of charge.

128
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,034
Follow me,
I will show you where all the slaves work.

129
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,505
Not... So your desk is...

130
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,805
Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
Oh, my God, it's really <i>you!</i>

131
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,506
I was just doing a little joke there
about how we'd never met.

132
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,912
I know, I don't care.

133
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,212
<i>Awesome!</i> Good to be back.

134
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,213
The place looks really good.

135
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,755
It's really good to see you.
You, too.

136
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,950
Where do I stand with Pam?

137
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,323
No idea. I mean, we're friends.

138
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,358
Always have been friends.
That is where we stand.

139
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,596
DWIGHT: Well, well, well.

140
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,434
Look what the cat dragged in
from Stamford.

141
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,531
Hey, Dwight.
Fact.

142
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,441
I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.

143
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,207
Okay, sounds good.

144
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,242
What are you doing?
I don't know what you're talking about.

145
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,309
Do I have a smudge on my forehead?
No, you look good.

146
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,378
Why are you looking at my forehead?
I'm not.

147
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,917
Meet my eye line, <i>Jim!</i>
I am.

148
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,826
Stop acting like an <i>idiot!</i>
Okay.

149
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,921
Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
Hey.

150
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,024
How are you, man? Good to see you.
I'm good. How are you?

151
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,565
So...

152
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,397
Oh, I'm sorry, are you sitting here now?

153
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,635
Yeah.

154
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,011
Unless you really, really want it back.

155
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,678
You know, man, it's really your call.
Cool, thank you.

156
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,249
Let me get that for you.

157
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,722
Got it?

158
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,458
This one taken? No? Good.

159
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:02,506
Yeah, Jim is a nice guy.
That's why I got the desk.

160
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,637
Michael Scott, thank you.
I appreciate it, Mike.

161
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,411
MICHAEL: All right.

162
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,310
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced.

163
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,683
Dwight Schrute,
Assistant Regional Manager.

164
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,780
Andy Bernard,
Regional Director in Charge of Sales.

165
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,085
So you'll be reporting to me, then.

166
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,216
On the contrary.

167
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,558
My title has "manager" in it.
And I'm a director.

168
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,224
Which, on a film set,
is the highest title there is.

169
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,824
Do you know anything about film?

170
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,894
I know everything about film.
I've seen over 240 of them.

171
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,466
Congratulations.

172
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,680
Hey, Toby.

173
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,977
Hey, Jim.
How are you, man?

174
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,484
Oh, really <i>good!</i>
I just wanted to say hi.

175
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,747
How are you? Hey, welcome back.

176
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,119
Oh, is that, like, your new thing, or...

177
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,215
No, I'm sorry, that's...

178
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,489
No, that's cool.
No, it's nothing, we'll just...

179
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:00,862
All right. Good to be back.
So...

180
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,264
Okay.
All right.

181
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,064
All right. Sorry about that.
No problem.

182
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,104
It was...
What?

183
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,467
Nothing.

184
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,011
"I present the orientation video."

185
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,845
We need to talk.
Not now.

186
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,747
Which is higher,
Assistant Regional Manager,

187
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,513
or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?

188
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,487
I told you the titles are irrelevant.
They just relate to pay scale.

189
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,183
Okay, so who gets paid more, me or Andy?

190
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:29,523
It is not a matter of more or less.
Your pay is just different, okay?

191
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,228
All <i>right!</i> Showtime, part one.

192
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,629
Okay, who reports to who?

193
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:38,068
I don't care, <i>Dwight!</i>
You all report to me. That's all that <i>matters!</i>

194
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,070
The rest of it just work out
amongst yourselves, okay?

195
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,834
And then if I want...
Work it out amongst yourselves, <i>please!</i>

196
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,638
I have a company to run.
Will you let me run the company?

197
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,804
I... One...
Will you? Please?

198
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,515
KELLY: <i>Jim!</i>
<i>Kelly!</i>

199
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,586
Oh, my God, I have so much to tell <i>you!</i>
Really?

200
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,184
Yes. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes,
they had a baby and they named it Suri,

201
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,955
and then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie,

202
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,293
they had a baby, too,
and they named it Shiloh.

203
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,492
And both babies are <i>amazing!</i>

204
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,161
Great. What's new with you?

205
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,829
I just told you.

206
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,567
Okay, everybody settled in? Good.

207
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,079
Why don't we all proceed
into the conference room,

208
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,878
or should I say the banquet hall?

209
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,108
For... Drum roll, please.

210
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,050

Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast.
Come on <i>in!</i>

213
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,696
MICHAEL: Don't be shy.

214
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,965
Hey, champagne.
No, no, guests only.

215
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,670
Smoked <i>salmon!</i>
No, for the guests it is,

216
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,435
for you, consider it cow meat.

217
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,473
Strictly taboo.
I eat beef.

218
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,012
Well, then, consider it poisoned beef.

219
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,104
It's no touchee.

220
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,775
The beef is poisoned?
No, it's not <i>beef!</i> Just...

221
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,910
Sit down, please. Welcome, help yourself.

222
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,647
You might want these orientation materials.

223
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,352
Wrong, Toby, this is an orientation,
not a bore-ientation.

224
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:14,264
Okay, do not worry. All of your questions
are about to be answered.

225
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,960
Cell phones and pagers off, please.

226
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,469
Oh, this looks promising.
You won't be disappointed.

227
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,337
MICHAEL: Let's face it, moving to a new job
can be very stressful,

228
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,505
so I have made an orientation video
especially for you newcomers.

229
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:33,583
But it's not like any orientation video
that any of you have ever seen.

230
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,582
It's funny.

231
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,890
It's got a little bit of a zing to it.

232
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,025
And I hope that it gives you a flavor

233
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,120
of what we're all about
here at Dunder Mifflin,

234
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,098
and what we're all about here in Scranton.

235
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,330
So let's just all laugh together.
And watch...

236

246
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:19,288
It reminds me of the orientation video
Michael showed on my first day,

00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,629
<i>The Scranton Witch Project.</i>

248
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,600

<i>Spot! Spot! Spot!</i>

Well, so far, I think it is killing.

256
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,250
I thought it would either be
an A or an A-plus,

257
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,817
but I completely forgot
that there is an A-plus-plus.

Oh, yeah, I'm trying to move away from that.

You've changed so much.
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.

286
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,130
So when do I get to hear everything?
Are you still getting unpacked, or...

287
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,403

Okay.

Crack the whip. All right.
Yeah, I know, me, too.

296
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,965
The day's going fine.
It's been a little chaotic, but it's fine.

297
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:21,877
It's great. A lot of distractions, but it's good.

298

Take a picture, it'll last longer.

299
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,389
I'm sorry, it's just... It's a little distracting.

What is that, a squid's eye, or...

303
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,546
It's my left breast.

304
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,380
How did you...
Right place at the right time.

305
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,291
Oh, what's that smell?
What smell?

306
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,062
There must be an air freshener
plugged in somewhere.

307
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,499
It smells like a funeral home.

308
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,628
Oh, I'll help you find it.

309
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,371
You know what, never mind.
What is it?

310
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,079
I think I'm just allergic to your perfume.

311
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,343
My perfume?
It's just my crazy nose.

312
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,717
I'm used to different smells.

313
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:40,216
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me
in metropolitan Orlando.

314
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,385
It's made from real pine.

You've a lot to learn
about this town, sweetie.

think they are.

I've sat downwind of Phyllis'
stinky perfumes for years.

319
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,633
Never said a word.

320
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,076
People hate people
that are different from them. That's natural.

321
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,580
<i>But you know what makes people</i>
<i>forget their differences?</i>

322
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,809
<i>A great show.</i>

323
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,148

<i>the integration celebration.</i>

327
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,594
I know a lot of you must be thinking,

328
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,030
"Wow, what a day.

329
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,967
"It feels more like a night at a party
than a day at work."

330
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,095
Well, in my opinion,

331
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,506
business should feel like a night out,

332
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,577
a night at

333
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,712
the Roxbury.

00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,683
Okay, there's supposed to be music,
and it's...

You can't quit on the first <i>day!</i>
That's heresy, my <i>friend!</i>

Okay, let's talk about this. What happened?
I mean, what...

Was it Toby? Did he say something?
'Cause he's...

391
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,840
No, Toby was helpful. He was very kind.

392
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,718
It's just your management style.

393
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,716
My management style? So...

394
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,754
Didn't you think <i>Lazy Scranton</i> was funny?
No.

395
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,298
Was it supposed to be funny?

396
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,731
Okay, well...

397
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,162
Don't bother quitting, because you're fired.

398
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,673
Excuse me?
You are <i>fired!</i>

399
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,642
I'm sorry,
but we don't have quitters on this <i>team!</i>

400
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,144
Just clean out your <i>desk!</i>

401
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,180
But there's nothing
in my desk except coupons.

402

Don't try to apologize to me, man.
It's too <i>late!</i> Just get <i>out!</i>

403
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,984
Take your bad vibes with <i>you!</i>

404
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,250
That was my advice.

405
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,121
Remember, I'm the one who suggested
that you fire <i>him!</i>

406
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,490
Probably the best advice
you ever gave me, Dwight.

407
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,930
And what advice has Andy given
to you today that you have acted on?

408
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:18,434
Would none be an accurate estimate?
None advice?

409
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,836
Fire Andy.

410
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,605
Fire Andy.

411
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,977
Dwight may have won the battle,

412
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,207
but I will win the next battle.

413
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,750
Tony was right.
This environment is dysfunctional.

414
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,754
Well, maybe that's because
some people treat it

415
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,585
like their own private Hooters strip club.

416
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,855
Whoa, Angela, hold on.
Hooters is a restaurant

417
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,894
with over 400 locations worldwide.

418
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:48,091
Back to work. We don't have to get along.
We just have to work together.

419
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,134
No, we do have to get along.

420
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,727
Can't we all just get along?

421
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:57,541
Or have we forgotten the words
of the Reverend King?

422
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,902
<i>The word "merger" comes</i>
<i>from the word "marriage"</i>

423
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,310
and that was what today was
supposed to be.

424

The loving union between people.

00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:10,414
Instead, it has become like
when my mom moved in with Jeff.

426
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:15,222

433
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,149
Man, they got us so bad.
We cannot let them get away with <i>this!</i>

434
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:47,758
We have got to pull together as one

<i>Yeah!</i>
Yeah?

436
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,793
I don't think we can do that.

437
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,227
Go home, Toby. Just...

438
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,061
Hey. Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?

439
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:59,832
Why? I will tell you why.
Because they saved the worst for <i>me!</i>

440
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,805
They put a hate note
under my windshield wiper.

441

Sometimes he brings more costumes.

When do people work?

455
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,342

I have decided to make
Jim my new number two.

If he even wants it.
It doesn't come with a pay raise.

No, it does, actually.

00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:07,184
No, I just had some other stuff I had to do.

503
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,317
Good.
What's up?

504
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,691
Oh, nothing, I just feel bad.

505
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,060
I feel like things were a little weird today,
or something.

506
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,758
What do you mean?

507
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,962
I just think I should tell you
that I've sort of started seeing someone.

508
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,499
And...

509
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,804
That's totally cool.
You can do whatever you want.

510
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,903
Okay, good.

511
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,676
We're friends. We'll always be friends.

512
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,045
Right.

513
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,985
It's good to have you back.

514
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,546
Yeah, good to be back.

515
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,366
Saw your dork-mobile in the parking lot.

516
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,838
What does it get, like,
four miles to the gallon?

517
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,499
Try double that.

518
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,442
Classic Trans Am, vintage American muscle.
Please.

519
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:04,208
Yeah, my Xterra is pretty sweet.
Luxurious yet rugged.

520
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,306
Leave it to the Japanese.

521
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,044
Xterra's not even a real word.

522
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,814
Actually, it is, it's Latin for "earth."

523
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,880
Oh, so you drive an X-earth?
Yeah, that makes sense.

524
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,653
I'd rather drive a classic Trans Am
than an X-earth.

525
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,960
Yeah, I bet you would.

526
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,090
Oh, by the way, 1985 called.
It wants its car back.

527
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,393
Well, I hope 1985 has a time machine,
'cause I drive an '87.

528
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,732
Speaking of time machines?

529
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,774
I just got back from the future,
and I went to your funeral, and guess what?

530
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,240
Nobody came.

531
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,803
Speaking of funerals,
why don't you go ahead and go die?

532
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:40,212
That was a really well-constructed sentence.

533
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,788
You should be an English professor
at Cor-Not University.

534
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,555
<i>Idiot!</i>

535
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,058
If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a Trans Am.

536
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,727
If you were driving a Trans Am,

537
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,889
you'd be the smartest idiot
in the whole world.

538
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,126
(COUGHING) <i>Idiot!</i>

539
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,962
(COUGHING) You're the idiot.

540
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,836
(COUGHING) Nice comeback.

541
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:05,202
(COUGHING) I was making fun
of your comeback. That's why it worked.

542
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,314
I totally got the best of that interchange.

543
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,781
(COUGHING)
