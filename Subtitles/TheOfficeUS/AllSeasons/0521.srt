when I got into that car
to go to New York,

2

that I was going
to be quitting.

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,533

and I was, like,
"Two hours.

At least he's in the building.

12

it was the wrong building.

14
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,428

we really wanna hear.

what happened?

20
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,667
I looked at Wallace
and I said,

21
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,006
"I quit."

22
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,148
And as I turned to leave,
I looked back,

23
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,242
and I said,
"You have no idea
how high I can fly."

24

You didn't tell him
how sick of him you were?

25
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,816
Why would I do that?

26
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,688
Well, wouldn't it
feel good to tell him
that he's incompetent or...

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,319
That he's wasted
15 years
of your life?

28
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,692
Maybe spit in his face?

thought about this
a lot more than I have.

like I have control
over my own life.

in a war we never
should have been in.

181
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,552
That's a really...
World War II.

182
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:14,356
Well, fine, did
the German instructions say
what this is supposed to do?

That is either
an incense dispenser

186
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,729
or a ceremonial

This order form,
instead of saying

191
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,913
is there any way
I could get it to
say something else?

192
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,855

193

194

Somebody's been
talking in bed.
Pillow talk.

195
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,690
Yeah. Listen, Michael.

196
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,259
Have you really
thought this through?

197
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,994
'Cause it's
a pretty big risk.

198
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,932
This is a dream

199

that I have had since lunch
and I am not
giving up on it now.

200
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,007
Yeah. You could give
it up, though, right?

201
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,670
And almost no one would know.

202
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,575
Before you got here,
I'm the one who landed
all of these clients.

203
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,084
Half of them. At least.

204
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,052
I can do it again.
I know the market.

205
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,554
I know the price points.

206
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,953
I'm on it. Don't worry.

207
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,823
So, how do I do that?

208
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,120
Well,

209
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,360
you can scan it,
and then you can
upload the image,

210
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,491
and then you can
copy a new image...

211
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,592
Could I take a piece of paper

212
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,832
and just tape it
with transparent tape?

213
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,165
Yeah. Good.

214
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,476
Thank you very much.

215

So that is why
I have to leave at 5:00
on Tuesdays.

216
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,708
It's to pick up
my little sisters
from school.

217

We're like the Kardashians.

you can run this stuff
by Toby.

219
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,382
Yeah, I don't like talking...

220
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,752
Come in.
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,791
I didn't realize
you were with anyone.

222
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,452
But I just wanted to
bring you the brochure
on that accounting seminar

223
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,519
that I was telling
you about earlier.

224
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,292
Okay, we're in the middle
of something, Angela, so...

225
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,232
Actually, you know,
it was so much fun last year.

226
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,768
There was a sundae bar.

227
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,064
I mean,
I didn't have any.

00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,866
You know,
to stay trim.

229
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,198
Did Michael just let
anybody in his office?

230
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,903
Yes. He loved to
facilitate communication.

231
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,536
He loved it.
He invited us in
all the time.

232
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,581
He was, like, "Come in."
Yeah.

233
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,515
I am aware of the effect
I have on women.

234
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,382
So you should be
heading back
to your desk.

235
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,517
Okay. Bye, Charles.

236
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,820

Well, we'll see.

We'll see.
Wow.

00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,572
It's just a...
It's a nugget of
an idea right now.

00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,665

he's saying something.

352
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,304
I think he's singing.

353
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,778
I can't believe this
is really happening.

354
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,376
And I feel free!

355
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,746
And just like that,
as mysteriously
as he arrived,

356
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,690
he was gone.

357
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,799
ANDY: The whole office
feels darker.

358
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,772
You know?

359
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,840
It's just a sad, dark day.

360
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,642
Andy, he's gone.

361
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,906
I know.

362
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,178
You don't have to
kiss his ass anymore.

363
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,280
Michael's like
a movie on a plane.

364
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,188
You know, it's not great,
but it's something to watch.

365
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,850
And then when it's over,
you're, like,

366
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,917
how much time is left
on this flight?

367
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,656
You know. Now what?

368
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,792
(RUSTLING)

369
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,096
Michael?

370
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,162
(SHUSHING)

371
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,003
(WHISPERING)
Don't look down.
Look straight up.

372
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,776
Come on. Please.

373
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,342
These are for employees only.

374
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,713
Angela, Kevin,
help me out.

375
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,881
I just need a few things,
and then I'll be gone.

376
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,016
Michael, why is it that
you asked everyone

377
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,153
except me, Angela,
Creed and Meredith?

378
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,595
I was going to.
I wanted to.

379
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,330
But I had to
start somewhere.

380
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,731
And you didn't want
to start with us?

381
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,859
No.

382
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,666
Of course not.
But now I want everybody.

383
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,131
Jim.

384
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,204
Buddy.

385
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,436
Buddy. Jimbo.

386
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,976
Did you have time to
think about my offer?

387
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,519
I did have a chance
to think about it,

388
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,815
but then I thought
about something else.

389
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,082
So, which way
are you leaning?

390
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,125
Well, it is tempting,
but I am 100%
leaning towards passing.

391
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,181
That's...

392
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,954
Did anyone see
the client list

393
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,054
that Michael was supposed
to be working on?

394
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,155
DWIGHT: No.

395
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,756
Okay, let me know
if you find it.

396
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,659
(DOOR CLOSES)

397
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,724
Okay.

398
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,565
Okay.

399
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,669
(PANTING) Okay,
we don't have much time.

400
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,270
Just act normal.

401
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,210
Don't look at me.
People, stop.

402
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,217
Don't look down.
Don't look down.
He's gonna see me.

403
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,617
Not all the way up.
Keep them at
a normal height.

404
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,315
Okay?
This is not Michael Scott
talking right now.

405
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,881
This is your future. Hello.

406
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,854
I am your future.

407
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,556
You are older and
you are very happy now,

408
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,759
because you went with
Michael Scott, right?

409
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,698
So, everybody,
come on down.

410
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,363
And let's just crawl
out of here together,
all right?

411
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,939
Come on!
Are you doing
your best here?

412
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,141
Are you being the best
that you can be?

413
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,011
All right, everybody
who's gonna go with me,

414
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,780
I want you
to stomp your foot.

415
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,546
Okay.

416
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,890
All right. Come on.

417
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,417
Come on.

418
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,260
You're coming with me.
Come on, Phyllis.

419
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,028
Here we go.

420
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,093
(DOOR OPENING)

421
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,365
Here we go.

422
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,871
Michael, get up.
Oh, God, okay.

423
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,307
All right, all right.
Time to go.

424
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,173
Time to go.
Jim, let's go.
Come on.

425
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,439
Come on!
Michael!

426
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,502
What are you doing?

427
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,980
I think maybe Hank
should be here.

428
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,574
Hank? You know,
I don't need Hank.

429
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,616
You're gonna mess with me?
Is that what you're gonna do?

430
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,417
I'll tell you something,
Charles.
I don't even care,

431
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,185
because I've got
nothing to lose.

432
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,158
Okay.
Oh, my God. No, God! No!

433
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,627
No. All right.
It's not won'th it.

434
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,299
Oh, no.
What?

435
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,801
I'm going with him.

436
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,073
What? Pam.

437
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,478
PAM: I'm going!

438
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,515
Pam, you can't be serious.

439
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,819
Michael, wait!

440
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,119
I'm coming with you.

441
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,324
You are?

442
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,118
Yeah.

443
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,795
(LAUGHING)

444
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,499
Okay. It's gonna be great.

445
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,593
Great. Except I don't want to
be a receptionist anymore.

446
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,133
Right.

447
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,101
Executive assistant.

448
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,234
Salesman.

449
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,505
MICHAEL: All right. Okay.

450
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,580
Deal.
Deal.

451
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,472
Okay, well, Jim?

452
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,575
Still no.

453
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,051
Okay.
Yeah.

454
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,785
Well, let's go.

455
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,880
All my stuff is
still upstairs.

456
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,422
Are people watching?

457
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,686
Probably.

458
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,730
Michael, it's not how
you leave an office.
It's how you...

459
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,162
Jim, Jim, Jim.

460
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,200
We're having
a company meeting here.

461
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,502
I will bring all
your stuff home.
Okay.

462
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,936
All right.
I'll see you later.

463
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,768
Bye.
See you later.

464
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,124
So, we had
a personnel change today.

465
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,821
Shouldrt affect
our day-to-day,

466
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,798
but until we get
a new receptionist,
I want Kevin on the phones.

467
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,828
Phones?

468
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,335
CHARLES: Also, there's been
way too much wasting time.

469
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,598
So, Stanley?
Yes?

470
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,196
Yeah, I want you
on top of that.

471
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,708
Okay, I want you to be
my productivity czar.

472
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,175
Okay? Good.

473
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,079
Okay, that's it on my list.

474
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,082
So, no excuses, guys.
Let's get going, okay?
