1
00:00:00,416 --> 00:00:01,504
Hey, Angela.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,590
Do you wanna see a picture of Philip
wearing those little booties you got us?

3
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:06,448
So cute.

4
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:09,804
Hey, you guys wanna see a picture of *?

5
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:13,453
He *

6
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:15,484
is all he wants to do.

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,809
Oscar thinks having a dog

8
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:19,344
is just like having a baby.

9
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:21,212
News flash,
if you didn't carry it around

10
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:23,448
in your belly for nine months,
it isn't your kid.

11
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,249
Exactly.

12
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:26,918
Unless you adopted, of course.

13
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:29,254
That is where we disagree.

14
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:31,088
Hey, are your little dudes
crawling yet?

15
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:35,109
No, three-month-old humans
don't do that.

16
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:37,996
My Philip is crawling.

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,934
- Angela is such a liar.
- It's maddening.

18
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:44,936
Exactly.
That's just like crate training.

19
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,121
All night long.
All night long.

20
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:48,740
[Chuckles]
Well, count yourself lucky.

21
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:50,341
Wait until you have two.

22
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:53,077
That's two sleep schedules,
two naps that don't coincide.

23
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:55,480
I mean,
you'll never sleep again.

24
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,515
No one said,
"you must have two."

25
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,633
Like her genes
are so important.

26
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:00,952
The world just needs
more Pam-Jim DNA.

27
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:03,321
- Thank you, no.
- No, thank you.

28
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:07,158
[Giggles, cackles]
Check this out.

29
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,826
My brother just got
a new sailboat.

30
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:12,430
He has no idea
what he just got himself into.

31
00:01:12,464 --> 00:01:14,599
There's nothing harder
than taking care of a boat.

32
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,317
Am I right?

33
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:17,435
Angela and Pam:
Unbelievable!

34
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,772
Un-be-lie-va-ble.

35
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:23,775
[Cheerful music]

00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:29,697
Sync and corrections by n17t01

37
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:34,118
It is the end of the day.
It is the end of the week.

38
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:38,389
We managed
to fill 40 hours somehow.

39
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:39,457
That's not bad, is it?

40
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:42,210
- [Laughs] Pretty good.
- That's great.

41
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,495
Well, thank you.
This is very helpful feedback.

42
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:47,065
Dwight, I am still
not ready to name a VP.

43
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,633
That's not
what I was gonna ask.

44
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:51,052
Gosh, jump to conclusions.

45
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:53,337
Come on, I know, you've got
so much on your plate.

46
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:55,974
Right now, you're like,
"oh, what's more important?

47
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:58,076
"Dwight's question,
figure out who's the VP?

48
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,745
Dwight, VP.
Dwight, VP."

49
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:03,147
Dwight, VP.
Dwight, VP...

50
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:04,649
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight.

51
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:06,851
I tried it,
I ended up smoking more.

52
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:08,052
Can we at least eliminate those

53
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,705
that are not in the running?

54
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,357
Free them up to focus
more completely on the menial.

55
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,859
Like stacking
and sorting, or--

56
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:16,193
Catching butterflies.

57
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,879
That's a hobby
unless it's for food.

58
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:19,864
- Theater.
- Waste of time.

59
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:22,367
- Dragging.
- That's just a verb.

60
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:23,584
Dragging sticks.

61
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:26,070
Yes, nice, perfect.
Dragging sticks--

62
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:29,741
All right, I'm gonna eliminate
three people right now, okay?

63
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,709
Just--
You three, no.

64
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:34,779
Not good enough.
[Clicks tongue]

65
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:36,981
English peoples' main use today

66
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:39,484
is judging American talent.

67
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:42,219
[British accent]
You're crap. You're wonderful.

68
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:44,455
They're-- they're mean,
but they're incisive.

69
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,358
Everyone meet
in the hotel bar at 7:00.

70
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:49,994
I'm not allowed
to say it's mandatory,

71
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:51,729
so let's just call it
"compulsory."

72
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:54,065
I'll be there at 6:00.

73
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,233
Ugh, we're gonna have one of
those crazy nights, aren't we?

74
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:57,919
Maybe we'll see
the real "Talla-nasty"

75
00:02:57,953 --> 00:02:59,203
we've been hearing
so much about.

76
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:01,205
- "Talla-nasty," very clever.
- Thank you.

77
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,425
Wait, wait, you think
she invented "Talla-nasty"?

78
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,961
[Chuckles] No, no, no, no...

79
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:08,413
Uh-uh.

80
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:12,884
Cathy? It's been great.
Fun, normal.

81
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:14,686
I thought I was gonna be hanging
out with Stanley on this trip,

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,938
but he's turned out to be
kind of a loose cannon.

83
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:18,890
My friend and I are new
here in Tallahassee.

84
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,825
Would you like
to get a cocktail?

85
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,760
Maybe go out
for a little dancing.

86
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:24,595
Beautiful day, no?

87
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:26,464
Okay, everybody.

88
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,283
5:00. Workday is over.
Put your pencils down.

89
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:31,953
And...
Bring 'em back up

90
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:35,106
because now
the late-night work jam begins.

91
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:37,208
Yes, the conference room
is set up.

92
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:39,777
I've got pens, I've got paper,
I've got a whiteboard.

93
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:41,829
- We are good to go!
- Say what?

94
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,464
We are good to go!

95
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:44,782
- Say what?
- We're good to go!

96
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:45,783
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Stop.

97
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:47,135
- Say--
- Andy.

98
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,986
Tonight we're staying late
to service the accounts

99
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,455
of the people who went
on the Florida trip.

100
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,789
Yes, of course,

101
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:53,257
we could've just been
doing this the whole time,

102
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:56,094
but someone dropped the ball.

103
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:59,263
Ball droppings
can be beautiful.

104
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:01,666
For example, when it
turns an awkward soprano

105
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,018
into a rich, full tenor.

106
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,940
Jason Bourne
would kick Bond's ass.

107
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:10,641
Jason Bourne
has no support staff.

108
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,143
His own government's
out to get him.

109
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:13,778
Genghis Khan
could take 'em both down

110
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:17,281
'cause he's not
afraid to kill children.

111
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:18,000
What?
It's true. He--

112
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:21,252
He would-- He would
eviscerate babies

113
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:23,504
and hang them from poles
outside of the villages.

114
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:27,008
Okay, drinking game.
Count of three, take three sips.

115
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:30,011
That's a stupid game.
I got a great drinking game.

116
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:31,879
Okay, everyone
empty your pockets.

117
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,564
Whoever has
the most seeds is the king,

118
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:36,851
whoever has the least buttons
is the hunchback.

119
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:38,836
What happens
if you're the hunchback?

120
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:41,339
- Oh, you get kicked.
- How many buttons do you have?

121
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:43,007
40. Always.

122
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,876
- Can I see?
- Sure.

123
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,477
So I get to kick you now.

124
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:48,713
No, they're not transferable
just 'cause I handed 'em to you.

125
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,081
Well, that's how
I played it in college.

126
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:52,516
- College rules. [Kicks]
- Aah!

127
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:55,870
And he lost
at his own lame game.

128
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,872
Ooh, double meaning.

129
00:04:57,906 --> 00:05:01,075
The game was lame,
and now he's lame from the kick.

130
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,076
Quick wit.

131
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,162
Thank you.

132
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:07,565
I'll have a glass of
your oakiest chardonnay, please.

133
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,219
And I will have a waffle
with your mapliest syrup.

134
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:13,371
Sorry, no waffles.

135
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:15,273
Oh, okay.
Just forget it, then.

136
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:17,391
Forget it.
Forget it.

137
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:18,609
A waffle?

138
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:21,012
A hotel waffle.
I know what I want to eat.

139
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:23,181
- Is that crazy?
- No.

140
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:24,549
I'm moving down here, you know.

141
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,785
Oh.
No, I didn't know.

142
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,254
I'm young, and I can.

143
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,857
And if I can't,
I'm still pretty young.

144
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,292
I guess I'll always be young.

145
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:39,764
You come with me.
We're gonna get you that waffle.

146
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:40,832
Why would Erin confide in me

147
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:42,200
that she's staying
here in Florida

148
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,417
if she didn't want me
to make some sort of last-ditch,

149
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:46,454
nothing-to-lose,
Kelly ka-who run at her?

150
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,089
- Hey.
- Hey.

151
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:50,958
- Watson Carpet And Tile.
- One order.

152
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:55,546
Order reference
number 00983-126.

153
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,548
Eight cases,
bright white inkjet.

154
00:05:57,582 --> 00:06:02,303
- Paid.
- I'm dying!

155
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:04,105
- Processed.
- And delivered.

156
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,724
Sometimes I get so bored
I just want to scream,

157
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:08,926
and then sometimes
I actually do scream.

158
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,963
I just sort of feel out
what the situation calls for.

159
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,766
- I will be right back.
- I will be here.

160
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:18,486
Hey, I see what you're doing.
It's futile.

161
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:20,271
The VP position is mine.

162
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,956
Oh, please.
You're through.

163
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,177
She's going to give it to me,
as I'm giving it to her tonight.

164
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,046
The cowgirl
has chosen her saddle.

165
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,282
[Clicks tongue, whinnies]

166
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:35,553
Well, saddles...
[Clicks tongue, whinnies]

167
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:37,138
Sometimes fall off,

168
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:39,840
especially if you don't
properly cinch the girth.

169
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:41,959
What?
That's a joke, right?

170
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:45,563
You see the way
she's all over me.

171
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:48,316
If anyone's having sex
with g for personal gain,

172
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,652
it's me,
and I'm not joking at all.

173
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:54,839
If you don't tighten
your saddle, you may fall off.

174
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,991
Who is ready for dinner?

175
00:06:57,025 --> 00:07:01,162
"Oh, I bet it's pizza or tacos
or something stupid."

176
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:03,147
No.
[Claps]

177
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:04,782
I went south of the border
for this.

178
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,483
And then I went south
of that border.

179
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,286
And we have ourselves...

180
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,504
[Jamaican accent]
A Jamaican feast, man.

181
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,672
- Ooh.
- Ugh.

182
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,040
If I wanted Jamaican food,

183
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:15,176
I'd just hire a bunch
of bodyguards and go there.

184
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,711
Additional trivia factoid,

185
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:19,547
this food comes
to us through Val.

186
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,217
And our server is none other
than Brandon, her "boyf."

187
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,436
- Hey.
- How you doing, Val?

188
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,437
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, babe.

189
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:27,638
Jamaican, huh?

190
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:30,308
I just read about
the elections down there.

191
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:31,475
Crazy stuff.

192
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,177
Oh, no, I'm not
actually Jamaican.

193
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,813
- Terrific.
- What's up, man? I'm Darryl.

194
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:37,982
Darryl, I heard about you.
You doing good?

195
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:39,717
- Oh, yeah.
- Must be doing real good

196
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,718
since you're fucking
my girlfriend.

197
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,204
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

198
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,022
Dude, you didn't tell me
you were fucking Val.

199
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,240
High five.

200
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,692
I'm not sleeping
with your girlfriend.

201
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:49,076
Brandon, what the hell
are you talking about?

202
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,527
Don't play dumb with me.
I know what's up.

203
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:51,762
Honey, I am not
sleeping with--

204
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,914
Hey!
Hey...

205
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,366
Let's get back to the food.

206
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:57,918
Brandon tell us about
these delicious-looking goops.

207
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,204
Hope you all like goat.

208
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:03,007
Goat.

209
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,109
- Blow in my ear.
- All right.

210
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:06,844
Like I'm on the beach.

211
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,946
- [Blows]
- Oh.

212
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:12,750
[Imitates seagull calls]
Seagull.

[Cawing]
And-- and a wave crashing.

214
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:18,723
A wave crashing.

[Both imitate waves]

216
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:23,260
Oh, that is lovely.

217
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,247
All right. That's gonna
do it for me tonight.

218
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:29,233
Have a lovely evening.

[Knock at door]

221
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:42,146
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey, uh, good.

222
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,082
Uh, the heating system though
in my room is all messed up.

223
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:46,951
It's, like,
90 degrees in there.

224
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,186
Maintenance is working on it.
Can I hang out in here?

225
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:51,922
Uh...Yeah, I'm just
watching basketball.

226
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:54,025
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

227
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,329
Cool.

228
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:00,464
Is this March Madness?
I love March Madness.

229
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,702
Oh, no, that's not this
'cause that's in March.

230
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:07,771
Uh, this is just the NBA.
Professional.

231
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,641
Miami Heat, actually.
So--

232
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,310
- Lebron James.
- Yes, nice.

233
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:18,149
Good word association.

234

[Crowd cheers on TV]

235
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,925
Impressive.

236
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:33,129
Oh, please,
anyone can tie a knot.

237
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:36,766
The real skill
is in untying it.

238
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,401
Mm...

239
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:41,537
- Thornwood Wholesalers.
- One order.

240
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,755
I read the text
you sent to Val, man.

241
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:44,274
That's messed up.

242
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,676
- Is this spicy?
- No, baby girl.

243
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,011
It would be messed up
if I didn't find anything,

244
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,262
but I did, so--

245
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:51,981
I'm pretty sure
if Darryl sent Val a text,

246
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:54,517
it was about some
paper emergency or something.

247
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:56,085
At midnight?

248
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,605
- Yeah.
- It happens.

249
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:00,773
Like a hospital needs
more napkins for surgery--

250
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:02,592
Guys, we're not gonna
settle anything this way.

251
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:03,576
I think we just
need to be grown-ups here.

252
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:04,911
Thank you.

253
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:06,262
I think we're gonna
need to hear those texts.

254
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:08,932
Kelly, remember how
you wanted to go home before?

255
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:11,367
No. There's no way
in hell I'm leaving.

Something interesting
is happening here

257

for once in my life.

is oddly out of rum.

265
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:30,787
Do you want
to watch the game with us?

266
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:33,473
We're watching a game.
The Heat game. Just a game.

267
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:35,441
Got it.
Good night.

268
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:38,144
Careful, Jim.
It gets easier and easier.

269

- No, no, no, Stanley.
- Mm-hmm.

270

- Stanley.
- Uh-huh.

All right, hey.

You know what?
Just bring back those bottles!

Whoa.
The lights are still on.

274
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,139
Yeah, they keep them on

275
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:52,075
'cause it's less expensive
than turning them on and off.

276

I like how guys
just know stuff all the time.

277

Girls know
a lot of stuff too, okay?

278

00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:22,458
did it run away fearful,

346
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:24,794
or did it walk away
smug, self-assured?

347
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,229
So smug.

348
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,448
Like he thought
it was funny, like this.

349
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:29,999
- Pssh. That's a bedbug.
- Yeah.

350
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:31,767
- Everything's a joke.
- I know.

351
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:34,237
- Check your hair.
- Ow.

352
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,407
God, oh. So greasy.
You should just shave all this.

353
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,942
- Just check it.
- You are clean.

354
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:41,444
Okay...

355
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:45,164
One thing a bedbug thrives on
is heat and carbon dioxide.

356
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:49,118
I am gonna generate myself
into a human trap.

357
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:50,619
When I jump into the bed,

358
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:53,506
you are gonna cover me
with the sheet immediately.

359
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:55,624
And then we'll see
who's laughing.

360
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:57,460
- All right.
- [Dastardly laugh]

361
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:00,480
Yeah.
Cover me!

362
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:03,032
- Is this really necessary?
- He knows what he's doing.

363
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:05,935
Let the bedbugs bite!

364
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,904
Ugh, God, I feel so gross.
I have to go take a shower.

365
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:10,973
All right,
then I will catch you later.

366
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:13,009
- What do we do now?
- We wait.

367
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:15,078
[Shower starts]

368
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,947
Come to papa.

369
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,982
Oh.

370
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,335
- [Speaking softly]
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:25,988
[Spraying]

372
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,042
I don't know, Dwight, I think
maybe you should check again.

373
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,178
Nope, I wasn't bitten.

374
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:33,513
Okay, well, maybe it's
not warm enough in here.

375
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:34,697
Oh, it's plenty warm,

376
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,349
and I was farting continuously
under the sheet,

377
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:37,800
creating a kind
of greenhouse effect.

378
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,018
- Come on.
- If there were any in here,

379
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,636
they would've embedded
themselves in me.

380
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,021
You know what?
Maybe they just ate.

381
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,173
No, you're good.
Clean bill of health.

382
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:46,225
Besides, I got to get
back downstairs.

383
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,478
I left Packer alone
with Nellie for way too long.

384
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,413
Okay, well, they're fine.
They're adults.

385
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,115
No, that's the problem.

386
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,450
Packer is trying to bed Nellie
for the VP job

387
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:55,651
unless I do it first.

388
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,053
Is that really
how you want to get this job?

389
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:58,871
Such a chorus girl.

390
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:01,073
Okay, Dwight...
Dwight...

391
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,042
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight.

392
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:07,413
Uh...

393
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:10,366
Is crazy gone?

394
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:12,001
[Rock and roll music]

395
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:15,037
[Laughs]

396
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,013
[Vomits]

397
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:27,950
Oh.

398
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:32,955
They don't make these cords
in boot cut anymore.

399
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,607
Oh.

400
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:37,109
Pathetic, huh?

401
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:40,563
A real man swallows his vomit
when a lady is present.

402
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,477
Hey.

403
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:51,081
Yes, one with chocolate,
one with vanilla.

404
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,922
Okay, cool.
Thanks.

405
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:56,258
- I know, I'm a pig, right?
- Hmm? No.

406
00:15:56,292 --> 00:16:00,178
[Giggles] Wait, this is why
I exercise like a fiend. Feel.

407
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:02,180
- Seriously.
- Okay, all right.

408
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:04,466
I'm really sorry, uh,
I just have to say it.

409
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,969
I'm-- I'm married.
I'm very happily married.

410
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:10,038
Oh, my God!
What are you thinking?

411
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:12,040
Um...

412
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:13,608
I mean--

413
00:16:13,642 --> 00:16:16,578
I know that you're married.
I sat at your wife's desk.

414
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,113
How little do you think of me?

415
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:21,450
I'm sorry,
I feel like maybe I'm-- I'm--

416
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:22,667
I misread things.

417
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:26,338
Okay.
Let's just go back to watching.

418
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,323
Can you without running

419
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:29,691
to the other side
of the room all night?

420
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:32,377
- Yes, I can.
- [Laughs]

421
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:35,864
Uh, all right.
I'm really sorry.

422
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:37,966
I think we'll just--
We'll just watch.

423
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,634
You can watch, not watch,
whatever you want to do.

424
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:41,036
Take another shower.
I don't care.

425
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,188
Okay.

426
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,906
[Sighs]

427
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:49,277
I am so cold.

428
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:53,565
Hey, Darryl.
You okay?

429
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:55,150
She's got a boyfriend.

430
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:59,020
Play it cool, man.
She'll come around.

431
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:00,589
No, you should go for it.

432
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:02,057
I mean, nothing would've
happened with me and Jim

433
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:03,792
if he didn't
put himself out there.

434
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:05,527
Yeah, but...

435
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:09,097
My friend Jim would tell you
to play it cool.

436
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:13,568
My husband would tell you
to go for it.

437
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:14,753
- Hey.
- Hey.

438
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:16,421
- Hey, this is fun.
- Hey.

439
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:18,440
- A lot of fun.
- I know.

440
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:19,808
Can I give you a compliment?

441
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:21,910
I'm really impressed
by how much you've grown.

442
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:24,179
Since I met you,
it's like night and day.

443
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:26,231
You should
move down here with me.

444
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:27,249
- Yeah?
- We could be roommates.

445
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:28,850
- Really?
- We could get a dog.

446
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:30,285
We could go
to R-rated movies.

447
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,822
And who knows, I mean,
you're a guy, I'm a girl--

448
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:36,825
- Yeah.
- Maybe in six months--

449
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,260
Six months?

450
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:43,281
Um, okay,
I'm in love with Kelly.

451
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,334
Put your forehead near mine,

452
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,936
and see if you can read
my thoughts.

453
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,039
Okay.

454
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:54,709
Seven, one, one, nine...

455
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:57,712
No, no, no.
Not numbers, no.

456
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,948
- No, okay.
- No.

457
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:03,768
Try again.

458
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:06,388
Ugh, I'm still getting numbers.

459
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:07,806
Seven, one, one--

460
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:11,643
Is anyone around here thinking
the numbers seven, one, one?

461
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:13,662
'Cause please stop, okay?

462
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:16,398
Dwight, give me
a key card to your room.

463
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:19,534
Meet me in seven minutes

464
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,604
for some one-on-one time.

465
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:23,838
[Gasps] Wait, the numbers!

466
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,790
Mm-hmm.

467
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:28,143
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

468
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:29,177
There you go.

469
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,446
I will see you
in seven--

470
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:35,166
Seven minutes.

471
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:44,960
Nellie, wait.

472
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:48,146
Let me write my room number
on the card.

473
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,315
[Chuckles]

474
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:53,184
Win at all costs.
Don't respect women.

475
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:54,936
These are the tenets
I was brought up with,

476
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:57,355
and they have served me well.

477
00:18:57,406 --> 00:19:00,141
But my ancestors never worked
in corporate America.

478
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:01,142
They were farmers.

479
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,811
And before that, hunters.

480
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:06,314
And before that,
time travelers.

481
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:09,200
And before that, me again.

482
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,835
At least,
that's how the legend goes.

483
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,155
The point is they never had to
worry about how they got ahead.

484
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,924
They just had to put food
on the table

485
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,293
and not alter the past.

486
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:22,330
1434-967, paid.

487
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:24,332
It has been processed.

488
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,517
It has been delivered.

489
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:27,686
That's it.
Last one.

490
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,836
[Applause] Whoo!

491
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:31,506
Andy, this has been
an amazing night. Epic.

492
00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:32,724
Cool-down fiesta
begins right now.

493
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,142
- I got decaf coffee.
- No way.

494
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:37,679
I got <i>Romy And Michele's</i>
<i>High School Reunion.</i>

495
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:39,864
Hey.

496
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:43,401
I just wanted to apologize.
I mean, that was so weird.

497
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:45,387
Can we just, like,
never talk about it again?

498
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:46,588
- Sure.
- Okay, thanks.

499
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:49,858
Hey, just so you know,
me and you--

500
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:52,060
I don't think
that's ridiculous.

501
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:53,631
Dot, dot, dot...

502
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,474
Dot, dot.

503
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:10,945
All right. Now I think
it's time for you to go.

504
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,747
What?

505
00:20:12,782 --> 00:20:14,733
Oh, Jim, I thought
we talked about this.

506
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:15,750
You're cool, right?

507
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:19,220
Cathy, go.

508
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:21,523
- Where's the bug?
- Awesome.

509
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:22,891
Stand back!

510
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:24,526
Aah! Stop it, oh, my God!
That burns! What is that?

511
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,928
It's a compound of chemicals
I pulled off of the maid's cart.

512
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:28,229
[Coughs] Oh, my God.

513
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:29,247
Dwight, there!

514
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:31,733
Oh, God, stop it!
Stop it!

515
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,201
[Coughs] Oh, big one!
Big one! Really big one!

516
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:34,569
- I can't breathe!
- I think I saw it!

517
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:35,570
Stop it!

518
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:37,706
[Coughs] Nice job.

519
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,040
I think you got 'em.
[Door closes]

520
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:41,976
You can't stay here.
This place is a biohazard.

521
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:43,424
If I were you,
I'd just bunk with Cathy.

522
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,458
[Scoffs]

523
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:52,062
[Tv noise]

524
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,932
Second best bananas foster
I've ever had.

525
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:57,117
Oh, yeah?
What's the first best?

526
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:59,453
Dwight?
[Knocks]

527
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:03,957
[Knocking]
Hello? Dwight...

528
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:04,775
- Is that Nellie?
- Don't let-- Shh.

529
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:07,305
Are you in there?

530
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:10,202
I can see the lights
under your door.

531
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:13,058
Hello?

532
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:16,482
Look, the light went off.

533
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,797
Just as I said the
light went on.

534
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:23,447
Dwight?

535
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:31,377
Oh, Dwight!
