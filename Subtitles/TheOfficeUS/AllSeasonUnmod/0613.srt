1
00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:02,169
- Attention, everyone!
Jim and I, on behalf of...

2
00:00:02,237 --> 00:00:03,838
- Too loud.
- The party planning committee,

3
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:05,306
- Too too loud, too loud.
- Have an annou--

4
00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:06,841
But effective. Look.

5
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:08,309
On behalf
of jim and I,

6
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:10,654
Merry christmas.

7
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:12,570
Merry christmas.

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,809
- Good.

9
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:17,308
- My diabolical plot
is on hold for christmas.

10
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:22,575
My heart just melts with
the sound of children singing.

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,214
Not really.

12
00:00:26,282 --> 00:00:28,286
I'm just tired.
The days are short.

13
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,757
I don't know.
Maybe I'm depressed.

14
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,865
It is time
to unveil the tree.

15
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,436
- Hey, rockefeller center.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:36,806
- Uh, I've actually
been to rock center,

17
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:37,810
And this is
nothing like that.

18
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:38,844
- This is all we have.

19
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,317
- Ugh.
- Nope, it's not "ugh."

20
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:44,386
It is office camaraderie.
- It is warm feelings.

21
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:46,121
- Why don't we talk more about
it instead of doing it?

22
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:49,057
- 30, 29, 28...

23
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,759
- Why would you start so high?
- 27...

24
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:52,660
- 3, 2, 1...
- 26...

25
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:53,694
- Ooh.
- Ah.

26
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,129
- You didn't decorate it.

27
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:58,231
- No, exactly.
- We didn't, because we think

28
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,399
It would be better
to do it together.

29
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,399
- Everyone.

30
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,234
- Why would you wrap it
in a sheet

31
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:03,402
If you're not covering
anything up?

32
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,002
- Is--is it fake?

33
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,370
- Pam.
- Yes!

34
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:09,540
We are unveiling
an artificial tree.

35
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:11,511
That will never die...
- Yes.

36
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,346
- Like the spirit
of christmas.

37
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:14,749
- And we're supposed
to applaud you

38
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:17,018
For you taking a giant diaper
off a fake tree?

39
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:18,654
- This was
a successful unveiling.

40
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:19,989
Go back to work!

41
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:21,659
Merry christmas.

43
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:46,091
- Hello. Sorry, guys.
Sorry, guys.

44
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:48,126
I'm not sure
I've earned the right

45
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:49,461
To make announcements yet,

46
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,231
But whoever is giving me
the twelve days of christmas

47
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,634
As my secret santa,

48
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:55,002
Please stop.

49
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,038
I can't take it anymore.

50
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:59,440
My cat killed
a turtledove.

51
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:01,844
The french hens have started
pulling out my hair

52
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:02,979
To make a nest.

53
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:04,814
Please stop.

54
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:09,118
- What psycho
would send that as a gift?

55
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:11,721
- I begged dwight and jim

56
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,589
To give me erin
for secret santa.

57
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:15,725
And I decided to give erin
the twelve days of christmas.

58
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:17,426
Bowtie time.

59
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:19,328
Is it my fault
that the first eight days

60
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:21,730
There's basically
30 birds?

61
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:25,767
- Ho, ho, ho!
Merry christmas, boys and girls.

62
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:28,303
It's me, santa claus.

63
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:29,572
- Hey, santa.

64
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,409
- They finally let you do it.
- Congrats, phyl.

65
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:33,610
- It's so edgy.

66
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:36,480
- I have been wanting
to be santa for years.

67
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:38,249
I believe I have
the right temperament

68
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:40,051
And the figure
to do the job well.

69
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,621
I slipped a note to jim
11 weeks ago,

70
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,190
And he said I could do it.

71
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:50,497
oh...It's been
a long journey...

72
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:55,371
But...
I'm santa claus!

73
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:58,441
- So, santa, what can we
expect from this party?

74
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:00,176
- It's going to be
a very jolly time

75
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:02,212
If you've been good.
- What if you've been bad?

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,981
- Oh, then nothing but
a lump of coal for you.

77
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,650
- What if you've been
really, really bad?

78
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:09,319
More "evil"
than strictly "wrong."

79
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:13,024
- Hey, creed, we covered it.
Lump of coal.

80
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,392
- For the past several weeks,

81
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,195
My secret santa has been
giving me pieces of a machine

82
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,731
That I've been attempting
to assemble.

83
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,299
I'm suspicious of this,

84
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,203
Because I had
the exact same idea

85
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,439
For catching osama bin laden.

86
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:28,609
I would simply send him
a different piece each day.

87
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:30,678
He would assemble it

88
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:35,050
To find himself...
In jail!

89
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:37,119
- You know, oscar, every time
I make this lasagna,

90
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:39,454
People ask me
if it's a family recipe.

91
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:43,626
But really...I just get
the recipe from the box.

92
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:45,494
- That's funny.

93
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,430
- Is it funny?
I thought it was more...

94
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:50,466
Interesting than funny.

95
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:56,707
I think my water just broke.

96
00:03:56,774 --> 00:04:00,143
- That's too funny.
- Oscar and the warehouse guy.

97
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:02,412
Go, oscar!

98
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,347
Go, gay warehouse guy!

99
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:07,551
- Here's...Santa!

100
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:10,854
Hey, little girl, what would
you like for christmas?

101
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:14,458
Ooh! You have been
a very naughty girl, I see.

102
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,861
- Michael, we already
have a santa--phyllis.

103
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:21,031
- What the hell is going on?

104
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:23,400
Phyllis, jim?
Phyllis is santa.

105
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:24,735
- Yeah.
- Phyllis.

106
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:26,203
- Yeah. I told her a long
time ago she could do it.

107
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:27,671
- Take it back.
That is absurd.

108
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,206
- No. I'm not gonna do that.
- No--no!

109
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:30,307
Jim, come on!

110
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:31,441
- I think she'll
do a good job.

111
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:32,742
- It's insane!
A woman santa?

112
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,178
Where does it stop?
No!

113
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:37,881
Jim, this may be the last
christmas that we have here.

114
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,617
Doesn't it make you
a tiny bit anxious

115
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:43,220
Me not playing santa?
Come on!

116
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:45,956
- I'm not gonna go tell phyllis
that she can't be santa.

117
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:47,992
- Fine. Then do it
anonymously.

118
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,761
Ransom note style.
You can...

119
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:51,229
You know what?

120
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:53,565
I have a bunch of letters
cut out of magazines in my desk.

121
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:54,800
You can use those.

122
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:56,335
If this were russia, yeah.

123
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:57,937
Sure, everybody
would go to one santa.

124
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,439
And there would be
a line around the block,

125
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,040
And once you sat on her lap

126
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:02,743
And she asked you
what you wanted,

127
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,778
You would say,
probably, "freedom"...

128
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,647
At which point the kgb
would arrest you

129
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,415
And send you to siberia.

130
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:11,551
It's a good thing russia
doesn't exist anymore.

131
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:12,919
Ho, ho, ho!

132
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:15,455
Ho, ho, ho!

133
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:20,526
Why pay more to sit next
to old tranny claus over there

134
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:22,528
When you can sit on my lap?

135
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:26,031
Phyllis is only pretending
to be a man.

136
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,532
I'm the real thing!

137
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,335
Sit down on my lap,
and there will be no doubt!

138
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,273
No, it's not,
like, penis-wise.

139
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,875
Hello, little boy!
What's your name?

140
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,710
- Michael, it's me, kevin.

141
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:41,112
Phyllis says
I'm too big for her lap.

142
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,182
- Oh, I am so sorry
that phyllis hates you

143
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,184
And hates your body.

144
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:50,054
But santa
remembers a reindeer

145
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:53,257
That was just a tiny bit
different as well.

146
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:55,025
- When can I sit on your lap?
- Right now!

147
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:58,362
Come on over here, big boy!

148
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,530
There we go!

149
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,032
oh, my god.

150
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,968
- It's really comfortable.

151
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,441
what would you
like for christmas, little boy?

152
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:12,745
- I don't know.

153
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:14,880
I-I didn't know
you were gonna ask me that.

154
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,417
- Well, what did you think
was going to happen?

155
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:18,952
- I didn't know.

156
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,788
Nobody's ever let me sit
on their lap before.

157
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:25,092
- all right,
just say some toys, please.

158
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,559
- Can you give me
some choices?

159
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,561
'cause I really don't wanna
mess up on this list.

160
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,496
- damn it, kevin.
Come on.

161
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:34,166
<i>- What about if I tell you
the things I don't want?</i>

162
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:35,233
- Okay--get off!
Get off!

163
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,401
Off!

164
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:39,037
oh, jee--god!

165
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,138
- I didn't even get to tell you
what I wanted.

166
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:42,706
- Okay, you know what
you get?

167
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:44,741
You get a thousand
helium balloons attached to you

168
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:46,742
So santa doesn't have
to go through this again.

169
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,712
oh!
- Awesome.

170
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,181
- Well?
- I'm trying, phyllis.

171
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:54,083
You're santa.
- The only santa.

172
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:55,117
- That's what I want.

173
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:56,952
- You promised me this.

174
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,554
Don't make me get bob
involved.

175
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:00,956
- What would bob do?
- Never mind.

176
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:03,226
I shouldn't have said that.

177
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:04,427
- Does it hurt?

178
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:06,162
- It stings a lot.
- Ehh.

179
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,165
- I keep trying to figure out
who's sending me these gifts.

180
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:10,566
- I know, right?

181
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:13,169
- So far,
no one will admit to it.

182
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:16,171
Is it you?

183
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:18,840
- yeah!

184
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,911
Totally.
I admit it.

185
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,846
It's me.
- Oh. Seriously?

186
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,580
- Seriously?

187
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:29,016
are you serious?
- Is--what--you--

188
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:31,251
- Yeah.
Totally serious.

189
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,853
I'm your secret santa.

190
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,388
Busted!

191
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,824
- There he is.
- Hey, man.

192
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:39,792
- Is matt around?
I've got his check.

193
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,226
- Uh, matt is on a delivery.

194
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,428
Just leave it here.
I'll take it.

195
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,665
- Ah. I'll just...
wait for him.

196
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,800
- Matt's a pretty good-lookin'
dude, don't you think?

197
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,402
- I'll just leave it
here with ya.

198
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,375
- What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

199
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,876
- Come here!
- I'm doing something here.

200
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,480
- Come on! Ah...
Ho, ho, ho!

201
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,248
Come on, I need this.
Come over here!

202
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,017
- What are you talking--
- just sit down.

203
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,485
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Is everything okay?

204
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,454
- Yep. Yeah. Ryan and I
are just having some fun.

205
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,222
- Can I just talk to you
for a second?

206
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,023
- Whoop!
Okay, what?

207
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,425
- You can't yell out,
"I need this, I need this,"

208
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,027
As you pin down an employee
on your lap.

209
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,463
-  Okay. You know what, jim?

210
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,965
With two santas in the room,
things get ruthless.

211
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,367
- Yeah.
- Do you understand?

212
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,369
You forced my hand.
- Okay. Michael, it's phyllis.

213
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,038
<i>We want phyllis as santa.
- Oh, do we? Do we?</i>

214
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,341
<i>Is that what we want?
Why don't we take a vote on it?</i>

215
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,010
- Great.
- Hey! Okay, everybody.

216
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,411
The office
is being pulled apart.

217
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,879
I realize that.

218
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:37,216
There are traditions
at stake.

219
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,417
And there are women--
- who wants phyllis as santa?

220
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:39,452
- No, no, no!

221
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,520
Wait! No!
There are other choices.

222
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,889
There's information that we--
are you kidding me, kevin?

223
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,058
After you almost killed me?

224
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,394
- Michael, I had you.
I just wanna try phyllis.

225
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:54,499
- And if you want michael
as santa, raise your hand.

226
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:55,833
Can I get you some punch?
- I--no.

227
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:59,337
I'll get some punch.

228
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:02,572
- Oh!
- Michael!

229
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,663
- Excuse me.

230
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:07,299
Whoever has been sending me
the parts to this gun,

231
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,636
I think you sent me a gear
instead of a trigger.

232
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:11,337
- How do you know
it's a gun?

233
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:14,541
- What else
does it look like?

234
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,410
- Not a gun.

235
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:18,479
- Well, I don't have
all the pieces yet.

236
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:20,981
- Well, unless the missing
pieces is a gun,

237
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:23,083
You don't have a gun.

238
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:27,287
Not a gun.

239
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:29,472
- In the north pole,
I spend many nights alone

240
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,407
Tinkering with toys.

241
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:34,611
So today,
let's put a twinkle

242
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,848
In old kris kringle's eye.

243
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,184
Let the party begin!

244
00:09:40,252 --> 00:09:42,787
- Whoa!

245
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:43,855
- Yay!

246
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,493
- I don't ask for much
from christmas.

247
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,094
I really don't.

248
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:51,363
It's not like I am begging
people to...

249
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:54,233
Buy me diamonds and...

250
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,969
Brooch pendants.

251
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:58,971
Oh, buy me something
expensive,

252
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,572
Or I'm gonna kill myself.

253
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,007
That's not...

254
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,575
I don't care about that!

255
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:05,777
All I wanna be is santa.

256
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:09,580
And...You want to take
that away from me, fine.

257
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:11,315
Go ahead.

258
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:14,451
But when you need my help
because I am ruining everything,

259
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,920
Don't look at me!

260
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:22,393
- Behold...

261
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:24,396
Jesus christ.

262
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:26,231
And I bring to you...

263
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,200
Glad christmas tidings.

264
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:29,868
I want to remind everyone

265
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:32,538
The true meaning
of christmas.

266
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:34,574
Those of you
who wish to join me,

267
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:37,176
That's great,
I am excited by that.

268
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:40,112
And those of you who don't,
I forgive you.

269
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,447
But I never forget.
- Oh, wow, michael.

270
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:45,116
This must be obvious
how wrong this is.

271
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:46,951
- Oh...The antichrist.

272
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:48,052
- Okay, you can't--
- sss!

273
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,020
- Ow! Look--
you cannot push religion.

274
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:51,688
- Oh, but I can push drugs
in here.

275
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:53,123
Is that what you're saying?
- No! You--

276
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,758
- Well, you have to pick
one or the other.

277
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:56,826
Your choice.
Pick your poison.

278
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:58,462
Get back to me.
In the meantime...

279
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,664
I am going to spread
my goodness

280
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:02,566
All over this company!

281
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:04,569
- Hey, phyllis?

282
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:09,007
Could you not reveal to erin
that I'm her secret santa?

283
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:10,543
- All right, sweetie, I'll just
tell her it's michael.

284
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:11,644
- Okay.

285
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,947
 I saw three ships 

286
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:16,183
 come sailing in 
- have you talked to him?

287
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,284
- What...

288
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,452
- Matt.

289
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,020
- Is it that obvious?

290
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,858
Oh...Hey.

291
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:28,428
- Mm. Good pate, right?

292
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:30,497
Oscar made it.

293
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,632
Have you met oscar?
- I don't think so.

294
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,034
Hey, oscar, come here.

295
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,138
-  on christmas day
in the morning 

296
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:40,807
Oscar, this is matt,

297
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,776
And, um, matt loves
your pate.

298
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,445
- I had some.

299
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:48,013
- Oscar's pate's great.

300
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:50,349
I could eat it all day,
every day.

301
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:53,218
Mm.

302
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:56,956
How come the good ones
are never straight, right?

303
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:59,125
- Okay, pam.
- Okay.

304
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:02,262
Yes. They're the only
two gay guys I know.

305
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,797
But they should be together.

306
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:06,032
- This just arrived

307
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,101
From the dunder mifflin
north pole branch.

308
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:09,636
- We don't have
a north pole branch.

309
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:11,137
Idiot!

310
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:13,706
uh-oh, what's dwight gonna get?

311
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,042
What is it?

312
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,377
- Yes!

313
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:19,479
- Oh, yes.
It's space garbage.

314
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:22,282
Dwight's gonna be able
to build himself a friend.

315
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,051
 deck the halls
with crappy...

316
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,720
- And stanley, ho, ho, ho!

317
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,555
You've been very good
this year.

318
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,823
- I have.

319
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:31,992
- Yeah, except for
cheating on your wife.

320
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,895
Adultery's a sin.
Look it up in the bible, people.

321
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,497
What'd he get?
- He got scented candles.

322
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:39,299
- Oh.
Well, that's appropriate.

323
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:42,636
A lotta fire where you're going.
Better get used to it.

324
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:44,805
You're going to h-e-l-l,
double hockey sticks.

325
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:47,941
Goin' to hell, stanley.
- Amen.

326
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:51,244
- And this brings us
to you, little one.

327
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,679
- I can't see from here,
people.

328
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:55,282
Somebody shout it out.
Don't make me get up.

329
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,552
- It's fabric.
I really wanted this.

330
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:00,253
- That's fantastic!

331
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,789
You can make another dress
that goes past your feet.

332
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:05,392
- Andy, was this you?
- It's a secret.

333
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,627
- No, andy had...Erin.

334
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,162
- That--
- michael!

335
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,530
- You--

336
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:11,831
- What, was I not
supposed to say?

337
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,700
what--turn it back on.

338
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,668
- No.

339
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:25,443
- Yes, michael.
What is so urgent?

340
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:27,712
- David, guess who I am
sitting here dressed as.

341
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,113
- I'm not going to guess.

342
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:30,414
You can tell me,
or I will hang up.

343
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:33,551
- I will give you a hint.
His last name is christ.

344
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:35,886
He has the power of flight.

345
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:36,987
He can heal leopards.

346
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:39,022
- Michael--
- I am jesus, david.

347
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,925
And you know why?
Because phyllis, a woman,

348
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:44,060
Has "uslurped"
my role as santa.

349
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:47,430
- Michael, this is
a very, very bad time.

350
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,332
- Really?

351
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,367
What's going on?

352
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:52,968
- Stephanie, can you hop off,
please?

353
00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:55,371
- Sure, david.
- What the hell?

354
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:58,140
How rude!
Does she do that all the time?

355
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,677
- Do you want me off
this call too, michael?

356
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:02,111
- Hey--what?
Get off!

357
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,314
Get off the phone!

358
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,450
listen...

359
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:09,320
I shouldn't tell you this,
but the company has a buyer.

360
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:11,622
The board will have no choice
but to approve,

361
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,325
And they are going
to clean house.

362
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:15,761
- What does that mean?

363
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:17,095
- I'll be fired.

364
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:20,032
- Well...Can't alan
protect you?

365
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,035
- Alan will be out too.
All of us.

366
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:24,270
Good-bye, michael.

367
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:26,572
oh, my god.

368
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:29,211
- Earlier today,
this office needed a santa.

369
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,548
And then it needed
a second santa.

370
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:36,151
And then it needed a jesus.

371
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:40,522
Now, it needs
a michael.

372
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:45,060
And that's one suit
phyllis cannot fit into.

373
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:48,164
- hey...

374
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,699
How's everybody doing?

375
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,200
- Not great.

376
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:53,036
You heckled santa
for an hour and a half.

377
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:54,538
- That was a different guy.
That was jesus.

378
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,074
Jesus sort of ruined
the party.

379
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:58,675
Hurt, petulant jesus.

380
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:01,245
- Are you serious?
That is so offensive.

381
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:04,315
- You know what's
even more offensive...

382
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:07,651
Is bailing on this party
because some...

383
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:11,121
Jerk ruined
the first part of it.

384
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:14,257
Dwight, come here.
Here's my debit card.

385
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:15,759
I want you to go pick up
a bunch of pizzas

386
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,327
And meet me
in the conference room.

387
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:21,097
- What's your pin number?
- I...Don't want to say.

388
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:24,634
But it's fun to stay
at the...

389
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:26,636
 it's fun to stay at the 

390
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:28,704
- Where?
Holiday inn.

391
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:29,972
I don't--

392
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:38,381
- I-I thought that
you would like it.

393
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,050
- It was a little much,
andy.

394
00:15:40,118 --> 00:15:43,087
- Well, it's the thought
that counts.

395
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:46,223
- What...Were you thinking?

396
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,061
- I suppose a gentleman
might throw in the towel

397
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,764
At this point.

398
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:55,167
Guess what.
Not gonna happen.

399
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:56,402
- You know what,

400
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:59,205
Christmas isn't
about santa or jesus.

401
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:01,406
It's about the workplace.

402
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,976
All of you...
Feel like my family.

403
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:06,311
Ryan, you are my son,

404
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:08,047
And...

405
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:11,116
Pam, you're my wife,
and jim...

406
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:14,820
And angela and phyllis,
you are my...Grandmas.

407
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:19,691
And stanley,
you're...Our mailman.

408
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:20,858
And I can't help but look

409
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:22,560
At all your wonderful,
beautiful faces

410
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:24,395
And think, "how could they
do this to us?"

411
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,464
- How could who do what to us?

412
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:28,232
- That's--not--nothing--
- why--

413
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,633
- It's just...
- We deserve to know.

414
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:32,468
- We're going out of business!
- What?

415
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:33,970
- What?
- You are kidding me.

416
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:35,638
- Wait, wait, wait.
Who said that?

417
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:38,507
- David told me on the phone.
- When did he tell you, today?

418
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:40,342
- Earlier today, he said...
- Oh!

419
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,212
- We have been sold.
- What?

420
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,581
- Aah!
- Dwight!

421
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,484
- Come on!
- Michael, wait.

422
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:50,186
So they said we are sold.

423
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:52,421
- David is gone, alan is gone.
We're all gone.

424
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:53,923
- Okay, but we haven't
gone under.

425
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,692
We've been sold, and that can
mean many different things.

426
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,061
- It's hard for me
to imagine a scenario

427
00:16:58,128 --> 00:16:59,696
Where meredith palmer
keeps her job,

428
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,331
And david wallace does not--
no offense, meredith.

429
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,732
- No, I get it.

430
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,668
- I'll call him.
I'll call david.

431
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:06,236
- No, you won't, because
he's not picking up his phone.

432
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:09,940
- Yes, I will, because I always
know how to get through to him.

433
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:12,009
He told me where
his kids go to school.

434
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:13,477
I call the school.

435
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:15,045
I tell them
I'm the pediatrician.

436
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:17,114
They patch me through
to his secretary.

437
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:20,617
I use my little girl voice.
Badda-bing, badda-boom.

438
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:23,354
- Hey, sweetie, what is it?
- It's not sweetie.

439
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,589
It's michael scott.
- What the hell--

440
00:17:25,657 --> 00:17:27,325
- Stephanie, could you
hop off, please?

441
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:28,793
- Michael--
I have never--

442
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:30,161
- David--
- never, ever--

443
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:32,297
- David, you are on speakerphone
with the entire branch

444
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:33,665
And the warehouse.

445
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:34,666
- Hi, david.
- Hey, david.

446
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:38,303
- Hi, everyone.

447
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,105
- David,
they do not believe me

448
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:43,109
When you told me
that everyone was canned.

449
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:45,411
- You weren't supposed
to tell anyone, michael.

450
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,813
- Well, I think
we're past that now.

451
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,381
- I am not supposed--

452
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:51,051
Okay, guys, I was really
only talking about

453
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,021
Alan, myself, and a few
other execs you don't know.

454
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:56,424
- Oh, my god, david,
that's...Horrible.

455
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,060
- How about us?
It's meredith.

456
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:01,396
By the way, your wife
is a very lucky woman.

457
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:04,866
- Look, they're buying the
company for the distribution.

458
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:07,335
You guys are the only thing
about this company that works.

459
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,772
So congratulations.
- We're not fired?

460
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,440
- No.
No, congratulations.

461
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,041
- All right!
- Yeah!

462
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:17,313
- It's a christmas miracle!

463
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:19,282
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

464
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:24,487
-  walk a lonely road 

465
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:27,690
 only one
that I have ever known 

466
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:30,193
 don't know where it goes 

467
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:33,563
 but it's all to me
and I walk alone 

468
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,698
It's true.

469
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:38,367
We all walk alone
at some point.

470
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:39,702
 

471
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,537
- Jim...
- Come on...Shall we?

472
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:44,307
-  I walk alone 
- jim!

473
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,808
 I walk a 

474
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,377
 my shadow's 

475
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:50,514
 the only one
that walks beside me 

476
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:54,317
 my shallow heart's the only
thing that's beating 

477
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,554
- Wow.

478
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,691
- Yeah. That was--
that was the idea.

479
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,092
- Thank you.
- Awesome.

480
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,596
- Thanks, man.

481
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:07,464
-  christmas tree 

482
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:11,268
-  thou leaves are so... 
- wait a minute.

483
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:12,736
- Of course!

484
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:14,672
- Oh! You got it?

485
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,842
- Ha ha!
- What is that?

486
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:19,744
- I have no idea.
- Huh...

487
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:21,213
- Well...

488
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,947
Maybe those'll help.

489
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:26,117
- Michael, please.
Come on.

490
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:27,752
- Sorry.
- Sure.

491
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:29,920
- Nice to meet you, oscar.
- Nice to meet you, mark.

492
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:32,422
- It's matt.
- Right, matt.

493
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,091
I know what I'm doing, pam.

494
00:19:41,664 --> 00:19:45,100
- Oh, man!

495
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:47,636
I can use this
for so many nuts--macadamias,

496
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:51,106
Brazil nuts, pecans,
almonds.

497
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:53,509
Clams. Snails.

498
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:55,510
- Hi, santa.

499
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:58,880
- Hi, michael.

500
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,450
Okay.

501
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:05,053
I'd like to make a wish.

502
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,155
- what?

503
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:10,291
- I would like an xbox
and...

504
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,029
A tv that's compatible
with an xbox.

505
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,130
And I'm sorry.

506
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:21,734
An xbox it is,

507
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:25,072
Because I've decided
you're a good boy.

508
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,574
- Scott.

509
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,209
What in the hell
is going on here?

510
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:29,911
- No, no, no.
- You called bob?

511
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,147
Phyllis!
- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

512
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,815
It's was earlier today.
- Okay.

513
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:35,718
- Hi, sweetheart.
- You okay, baby?

514
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,353
- I'm good, baby.
- Oh, god.

515
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:38,555
Get a room, santas.

516
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,008
- Thank you, santa.

517
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,677
It's a little slippery
out here.

518
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,249
- Oh, my god.

519
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,118
- Twelve drummers drumming.

521
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,820
Merry Christmas, Aaron.

522
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:09,521
Sing it away, boys.
