1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,850
Go! Gotcha you! Broken arm!

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,800
Boom! Boom boom! Broken nose!

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,890
Boom boom boom! Broken nose! Boom!

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,330
<i>TOPTOPTHIS YEAR IN MARTIAL ARTS:</i>

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,850
Once a year, Dwight holds a seminar updating us,
a newest dewelopment of Karate!

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,690
as we all know,the one thing

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,960
that thousand-year-old martial
arts do all the time is change.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,700
How can i pose this to
you in a relatable way?

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,740
You are all members of the yakuza,

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,810
and you happen to be visiting
the lackawanna trolley museum,

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,450
and you are attacked by triads.

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,190
How can you hold them off
until your clan arrives?

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,440
You cannot go wrong with a throat punch.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,880
Okay,so there's no defense
for that? Good to know.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,530
No,there is a defense for that.

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,410
Let me demonstrate.
Someone attack me. Kevin,go!

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,930
No way. Last time,you
pulled my pants down,

18
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,410
and then you tried to
choke me with my shoelace.

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,240
False. I did choke you with
your shoelace. Now come at me!

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,980
Okay,with all due
respect to everyone here,

21
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,680
i think the most worthy
opponent of you is you.

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,820
That is correct,unless there
happen to be measles present.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,700
So let's just say that dwight has
come at you with the throat punch.

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,940
Now,how would you,dwight,
defend against it?

25
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,980
Easy. Allow me to demonstrate.

26
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,150
I am attacking myself
with a throat punch.

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,490
Here it comes. Block.

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,790
Grasp wrist as such.

29
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,190
And what if he comes at
you with the other hand?

30
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,460
Because he does have two.

31
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,860
Good point. Second throat punch.

32
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,880
Absorb the blow.

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,370
Groin punch.

34
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,780
Hit,block,elbow to the gut!

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,970
Up to the nose! No,you're not!

36
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,900
Oh,my god,he's making
you look like such a fool.

37
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,860
He really is,but not for long.

38
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,000
God! Instep!

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,550
Boh! Not again!

40
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,290
You let go! You let go!

41
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,180
Oh,you're right! I can't hold on!

42
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,460
You two are so evenly matched,i don't know
how one of you's gonna get the upper hand.

43
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,270
The important thing to remember,jim,

44
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,740
we always have what is called
the element of surprise.

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,180
But i would say my favorite art form

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,410
is a tie between sculpting
and stand-up comedy.

50
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,590
I did stand-up comedy once.

51
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,110
- You did?
- Yeah,i killed.

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,570
- That sounds like it was hilarious.
- It was hilarious.

53
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,610
- Michael?
- Yes?

54
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,620
What is the meaning of this
email that everyone got?

55
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,570
You'll have to be more specific,dwight.

56
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,370
I get like eight emails a day.

57
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,510
This one. "from: david
wallace,to: all dunder mifflin.

58
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,940
" whoo-hoo.
Shout-out.

59
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,100
"hello,everyone,i'm sure you've
seen "the item in the journal.

60
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
"just want to stress
it's all conjecture.

61
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,440
"if there's any concrete
news,you will know a. S. A. P.

62
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,600
" erin,do we have the journal?

63
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,850
Your feelings journal? You told
me to put it in the time capsule.

64
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,310
- Did you?
- Michael,he means the wall street journal online.

65
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,830
Oh,the wall.

66
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,640
I found the article.

67
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,110
"on a day marked by panicked
corporate board meetings,

68
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,400
"one that is relatively
unsurprising "is dunder mifflin's.

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,620
It is rumored that they
will recommend de--"

70
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,680
and the article cuts off.

71
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,070
It's $1. 99 to finish the article.

72
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,110
I wonder what it was gonna say.

73
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,580
Are you serious?

74
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,300
I got it,i got it.

75
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,250
Tuna beat me to it.

76
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,830
"it is rumored that they will
recommend declaring bankruptcy"?

77
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,420
No,no. That doesn't make any sense.

78
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,710
Oh,lord,we're all gonna lose our jobs.

79
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,920
Not necessarily. Bankruptcy
could mean a lot of things.

80
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,630
Maybe they're just
restructuring to get out of debt.

81
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,330
Oh,that sounds awful.

82
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,070
Or it could mean the
end of dunder mifflin.

83
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,310
Oh,god! Well,that's
an interesting theory.

84
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,280
You know what? You can all
have jobs at schrute farms...

85
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,050
As human scarecrows.

86
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,390
It doesn't pay much
and you can't unionize.

87
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,140
I'm sorry,michael. David's in a meeting.

88
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,010
Ah,well,maybe you should spy on him.

89
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,180
Oh,my god! Wouldn't that be hilarious?

90
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,460
um,i'll just have him call you back.

91
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,520
Okay,okay. Good.

92
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,230
I'll catch you on the
flippity-flip. Bye!

93
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,090
He's busy. Call me back when he's free.

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,210
michael,are you okay?
Did you throw up in there?

95
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,860
No,just poopin'. You know how i be.

96
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,920
But it smells like throw-up in here.

97
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,120
Crazy world,lotta smells.

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,430
You guys,what if this
is our last day at work?

99
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,020
What if we never see
each other ever again?

100
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,970
I like erin. There,i said it.

101
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,640
I was kinda hoping she would ask me out,

102
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,860
but things have not panned
out on that front,so...

103
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,430
It is time for the nard-dog to
take matters into his own paws.

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,500
We have to do something,

105
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,980
because people are losin' it out there,

106
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,480
wondering what's gonna happen.

107
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,880
Okay,we need some sort of
distraction for everybody.

108
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,440
Is there anything new in youtube?

109
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,210
- Michael-- - doesn't
even need to be good.

110
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,120
Oh,god! I can't think.
I need more mullins.

111
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,560
listen,wallace said these
were just rumors,right?

112
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,330
So we have no reason to think that
the company's anything but fine.

113
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,970
So if we just go on with our work,

114
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,860
you and me,they'll follow along.

115
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,600
- Monkey see,monkey do.
- That's it.

116
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Monkey pee all over you.

117
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,700
That... Rhymes.

118
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,270
So what have we on the docket today?

119
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,730
We have a...

120
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,000
A monthly staff meeting.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,880
All right! Let's conference room it up!

122
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,310
Here's the deal,guys. There is
no new information as of yet,

123
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,300
so i suggest we all just keep working.

124
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,740
Sure,i'm a little nervous,but doing
our work will make us feel better.

125
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,480
I only slack off when things are good.

126
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,330
Customers have to use the
coupon code from the website.

127
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,380
and as of now,there is no differentiation
between the letter "o" and the zero,

128
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,760
but we are working on that.

129
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,850
Stay tuned for that.

130
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,090
He needs me. Seat-save infinity.

131
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,150
- Okay,great.
- Oh,god!

132
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,460
What?

133
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,970
Oh,my god.

134
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,840
- What?
- What is it?

135
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,870
Is there news?

136
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,520
There has been a murder!

137
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,620
- What? - A
mur-- -what?

138
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,590
There's been a murder... In savannah.

139
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,900
Games have the power to distract
people from stressful situations.

140
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,470
"battleship" got me
through my parents' divorce.

141
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,770
"operation" got me through my
vasectomy,i. E. My operation.

142
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,190
I don't think i would have been able to

143
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,650
endure my break-up with holly
had it not been for "toss across.

144
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,480
"belles,bourbon,and bullets,

145
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,460
a murder mystery dinner party game.

146
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,760
it is so much fun.

147
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,620
Everybody plays a character,we
go around the room,

148
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,690
we try to figure out who did it.

149
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,310
Hey,i'm wondering if this
is a,um,terrible idea.

150
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,130
This is my call,jim. Big
picture stuff. It's about murder.

151
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,680
I thought we agreed that we
wouldn't do things like this.

152
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,870
Tube city. You owe me one.

153
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,120
Co-managing is a give and take.

154
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,580
You have to pick your battles.

155
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,380
One of the battles that i picked

156
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,780
was to stop michael from
running plastic tubes

157
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,180
all over the office and
placing hamsters inside of them.

158
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,690
He was gonna call it tube city.

159
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,420
So,yes,i do owe him one.

160
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,080
august 5,1955.

161
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,830
it's a sad day down here in savannah.

162
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,870
Local magnate bill bourbon
was killed last night,

163
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,220
and all y'all have
congregated tonight for a meal

164
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,520
to celebrate bill as he
passes on to his great reward.

165
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,560
But you're not just here
to pay your respects.

166
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,060
You have to figure out which of y'all

167
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,960
is the no-account
scoundrel who killed him.

168
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,250
This is ridiculous.

169
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,570
There will be food. You
leave,you do not get food.

170
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,180
- What kind of food?
- Sandwich platters.

171
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,560
- I'm in.
- Baby carrots.

172
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,250
Okay,here are your character cards.

173
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,180
Take one,pass it down.

174
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,660
Here is your prop box.

175
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,150
Some of your characters will have props.

176
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,880
Now,on your character card,

177
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,240
it tells you who you are
and what your alibi is.

178
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,620
Everything else is up
to your imagination.

179
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,070
So if you talk slowly in real
life,your character could,

180
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,760
say,have been kicked
in the head by a horse.

181
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,030
Cool. I'll try it.

182
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,410
Okay. Use your imaginations.

183
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,660
Who did you get?

184
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,100
"naughty nellie nutmeg,

185
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,070
a vivacious young socialite
with a penchant for scandal.

186
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,750
- ooh! Saucy.
- How about you?

187
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,900
"nathaniel nutmeg,the
local bartender and...

188
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,250
Nellie's brother.

189
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,400
michael,i don't like
this game. It's scary.

190
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,640
It's not scary.

191
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,100
I don't like my character.

192
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,240
Who are you?

193
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,720
"voodoo mama juju,the witch
doctor of the savannah swamps.

194
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,070
" i'm not comfortable with this.

195
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,290
Well,how do you think i feel?

196
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,400
I mean,i have to play caleb
crawdad,handsome playboy.

197
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,410
Every night,a different woman,

198
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,970
being oogled,having to
hug and kiss and spoon.

199
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,440
Oh! I make them feel beautiful.

200
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,790
Well,well,well!

201
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,280
What is this contraption,i do declare?

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,640
It's my blackberry,michael. I'm
trying to get updates on the company.

203
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,300
Who's michael? I'm caleb
crawdad,i do declare.

204
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,980
You don't have to keep
saying,"i do declare.

205
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,720
" anytime you say something
it means you're declaring.

206
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,290
That is the way southern people talk.

207
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,240
And what designing woman
are you basing that on?

208
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,810
Delta burke,i do declare.

209
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,200
Now,shall we get to the mystery?

210
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,660
I'll go.

211
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,740
"my name is deborah
utante,deb for short.

212
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,030
that's clever. Debutante.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,410
"bill bourbon was my uncle.

214
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,290
"i would have never hurt him any
more than i'd hurt a june bug.

215
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,690
nice accent. You sound
like forrest gump.

216
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,980
- I do not.
- Well,you do,actually.

217
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,840
You got this kind of like
florida panhandle thing goin',

218
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,210
whereas what you really want
is more of a savannah accent,

219
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,270
which is more like molasses,just
sort of spillin' out of your mouth.

220
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,140
Oh,now do the swedish chef.

221
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,500
Uh,i'm not familiar.
What province is he from?

222
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,300
He lives on sesame street,dumbass.

223
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,790
You know,i think i'm supposed to say
something to pam-- i mean,deb. Okay.

224
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,070
Um... "i overheard you askin' the
butler where the pistol was kept.

225
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,650
wait a minute! Wait a minute!

226
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm the butler. You were listening
in on that? Oh,you rich people.

227
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,670
You think you can do whatever
you want to the servant class!

228
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,440
No,no,no. Don't turn this
into a political thing.

229
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,380
I will poison your food.

230
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,510
I reckon i got somethin' to say

231
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,110
to miss beatrix bourbon
if'n she don't mind.

232
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,470
Ooh,doggy! We got a party now!

233
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,610
I do believe that the game is a big hit.

234
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,890
People are really divin'
into their characters.

235
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,630
Y'all...

236
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,670
i made a mistake.

237
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,160
Sorry i'm late,boss. What's goin' on?

238
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,900
Sir,there has been a
murder,and you are a suspect.

239
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,710
Okay. Hang on just a second.

240
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,520
Let me settle in,and i'll be right back.

241
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,330
Very good! Very good!

242
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,370
Now,no one was there in the wine cellar.

243
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,420
- hey,there,young lady.
- Hello.

244
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,980
I would be remiss if i did
not ask the pretty young lady

245
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,620
out on a date for this weekend.

246
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,150
Sounds like a plan,sugar.

247
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,060
All right!

248
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,280
A plan it is.

249
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,510
voodoo mama juju,explain your
dalliance with the dark arts.

250
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,600
It's not my fault. I was
exposed to harry potter.

251
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,180
I know you did it!

252
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,560
I know she didn't do it.

253
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,750
It's never the person you most suspect.

254
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,160
It's also never the
person you least suspect,

255
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,530
since anyone with half a brain
would suspect them the most.

256
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,040
Therefore,i know the
killer to be phyllis,

257
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,020
a.K.A.Beatrix bourbon,

258
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,170
the person i most medium suspect.

259
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,850
Do you want to go out on a date with me?

260
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,630
We can make out by the horses.

261
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,830
Well,you know old nellie is
always up for a romp in the hay.

262
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,010
How 'bout a threesome?

263
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,380
Yeah. My boudoir's always open.

264
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,980
Nice.

265
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,740
I'm a little worried i might have
asked out naughty nellie and not erin.

266
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,040
Which would be a whole
lot less appealing,

267
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,390
because naughty nellie
says yes to everyone,

268
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,850
and she might be a murderer.

269
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,550
Follow before...

270
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,110
i just got an email from corporate,

271
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,190
specifically for accounting to
stop all payments to our vendors.

272
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,590
What does that mean?

273
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,140
Well,maybe nothing,but
it could be a prob--

274
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,130
What's this strange yankee accent
comin' out of your mouth,son?

275
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,700
This here is savannah.

276
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,430
Phyllis,uh...

277
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,670
Uh... This...

278
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,240
Uh,plan--planta--
this plantation,

279
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,220
we're runnin' low on,uh,greenbacks,

280
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,400
and we're havin'
problems payin' the people

281
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,990
who give us the seeds and the dirt.

282
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,160
We can't pay 'em.

283
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,140
Michael,i
can't-- basically,

284
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,320
it could mean a lot of things,

285
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,810
but it is unprecedented,

286
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,000
so it's cause for concern.

287
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,560
Okay,i'm going back to work.

288
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,760
No. No,no. No. No.

289
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,030
No,no,i'm gonna skip forward to
a really big clue. Here we go.

290
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,430
Narrator on cd: well,by now,you figured

291
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,890
out that old beatrix
bourbon was the killer.

292
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,270
What?

293
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,640
Michael,i was doing so well.

294
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,520
Are you goin' to believe that?

295
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,540
That is a mis--
that's a misdirection.

296
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,790
We still don't know who the murderer is.

297
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,010
Nellie nutmeg,come back in heyah!

298
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,160
I can't do this mahself.

299
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,360
Voodoo mama juju!

300
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,950
What am i gonna do?

301
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,490
Okay,so corporate is
still in their meeting.

302
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,280
That could be a good sign.

303
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,070
Hey,everyone,kevin's gonna give
us his take on the situation.

304
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,460
Let's listen up.

305
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,180
All right,guys,it's a workday,

306
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,460
and you guys work here,so
let's go do some work.

307
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,060
Now,jim telling us all to work,

308
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,460
i think that is a very good sign.

309
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,630
Don't just say things.

310
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,160
oh,good,michael.

311
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,600
Listen,i wrote up
those sales targets-- -

312
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,640
i do believe you have me mistaken.

313
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,760
My name is caleb crawdad.

314
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,190
Y'all skedaddled way too soon.

315
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,000
We need to re-open this case.

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,190
No,you're not re-opening
the case. The case is closed.

317
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,590
No,it ain't.

318
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,910
Frankly,i'm not surprised.

319
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,190
A lot of the evidence
seemed to be based on puns.

320
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,550
i was just thinking
about weekend at bernie's.

321
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,110
So funny. The guy's dead the whole time.

322
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,480
I haven't seen it.

323
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,760
Speaking of weekends,you excited
about our date this weekend?

324
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,020
Of course,nathaniel.

325
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,500
Okay.

326
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,550
Where are you takin' me?

327
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,380
Well...

328
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,950
The finest steakhouse in all savannah.

329
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,260
Savannah?

330
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,650
That's a far way from scranton.

331
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,890
Did you mean a real date?

332
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,590
No.

333
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,960
- Did you?
- Totally not.

334
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,990
I thought it was for real...

335
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,160
So i was excited,but it was
just-- it was part of the game.

336
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,880
You're sure it was water?

337
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,990
It couldn't have been acid?

338
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,820
I already declared you
it was too dark to tell!

339
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,240
Stop playing games with me,crawdad!

340
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,400
This is not a game! This is my life!

341
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,720
- You are out of order,sir!
- Answer me!

342
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,470
- You are out of order!
- You are out of order!

343
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,710
- You are out-- - i think
michael may have snapped.

344
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,430
Or maybe he's just stuck in character.

345
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,060
Well,which is worse? Snapped or stuck?

346
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,290
Both. They're both worse.

347
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,580
It's gonna be all right.
We're a good company.

348
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,560
We'll figure this out.

349
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,330
We're not going under.

350
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,210
Jim,what if we both lose our jobs?

351
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,160
I'm trying to think of a way that this

352
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,600
all ends up fine,and
i can't think of one.

353
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,720
Deb,what in the world?
Do you have the vapors?

354
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,860
Michael! Not now.

355
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,050
Can't wait. We have to get you
to our witch doctor right now.

356
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,140
Come on. come on!

357
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,540
I should just go.

358
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,680
Where to now,caleb?

359
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,310
To mama juju boo-boo.

360
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,810
Michael,can
i--

361
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,830
okay,i'm just gonna skip right
past the what and go with why?

362
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,660
Because this is the
re-creation of a crime scene.

363
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm the dead body,and
these are my brain chunks.

364
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,870
Hey,shut up. You're dead.

365
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,350
Michael,can i talk
to you in your office?

366
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,520
- No michael here.
- Caleb!

367
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,600
- Today,of all days--
- no! You shut up!

368
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,830
They need this game,jim.

369
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,150
Let us have this stupid
little game,all right?

370
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,510
You startled me!

371
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,530
My stars,my heart nearly
leapt out of my chest.

372
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,870
What can i do you for?

373
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,550
Wallace is on the phone.
He's returning your call.

374
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,710
- Detective wallace?
- I don't think so.

375
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,520
I think it's david wallace
from dunder mifflin.

376
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,230
Aw,shucks. Tell him i'm not heyah.

377
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,370
You're not gonna answer the phone?

378
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,040
No,i only answer to detective wallace,

379
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,890
'cause i got a warm
body in the other room.

380
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,010
I'll take it.

381
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,120
- Hey,david.
- Hey.

382
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,420
Sorry to be gettin'
back to you guys so late.

383
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,740
Things are still a bit unclear.

384
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,900
We didn't officially
decide anything yet.

385
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,690
Oh,okay.

386
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,980
But if i can be candid
with you here,jim...

387
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,290
It's not good. We fully
expect to be out of money

388
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,730
by the end of the
year-- insolvent.

389
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,240
So... Well,you know what?

390
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,290
I'm sorry. I have to run.

391
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,690
- But we will talk soon,okay?
- Sure. Okay.

392
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,910
Oh,you know,while i have you,

393
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,630
- today i was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain...
- great.

394
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,170
And it would actually be a big account.

395
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,530
Okay,look,you know what?

396
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,280
I can't really get my
head around anything

397
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,490
like that right now,but that's great.

398
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,880
Keep after it,but i gotta run.

399
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,960
- Okay. -
Thanks,jim. - See ya.

400
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,980
What's the news?

401
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,650
Nothing yet.

402
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,250
Well,i guess that's not...

403
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,560
well,there is some bad news.

404
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,150
There has been another murder.

405
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,390
A murder,you say?

406
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,330
I do declare.

407
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,110
Conference room,everyone.

408
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,490
Do we have to play?

409
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,360
- No.
- Super.

410
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,750
Oh,this could be a juicy one.

411
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,580
Get in there! Get in there!

412
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,180
I think today was a good
day to have two managers,

413
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,450
because if you're a
family stuck on a lifeboat

414
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,820
in the middle of the ocean,

415
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,480
one parent might want
to just keep rowing.

416
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,400
But if the other parent
wants to play a game,

417
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,260
it's not because they're crazy.

418
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,600
It's because they're
doing it for the kids.

419
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,500
And i get that now.

420
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,820
There has been a lot of
murder and a lot of intrigue.

421
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,450
My little heart can
barely take it no more.

422
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,600
Today is the hardest i have
worked in a long,long time.

423
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,510
- I didn't do it!
- Okay.

424
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,930
- ever'body just calm down.
- I am calm.

425
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,020
Count of three,we're all
gonna put down our guns.

426
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,750
I have crossbows.

427
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,880
- We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three.
- Okay.

428
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,480
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

429
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,170
One... Two... two.

430
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,730
Three. Three.

431
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,720
andy revealed himself
to be a double agent,

432
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,270
at which point,dwight
felt comfortable revealing

433
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,910
that he also was a double agent,

434
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,650
and then,michael announced
to everybody that,

435
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,190
get this,he was a double agent.

436
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,900
Oh,and it is 6:00.

437
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,770
really?

438
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,830
It wasn't me!

439
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,110
I'm not goin' down for this!

440
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,090
Hey,i want to go home.

441
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,460
Get the keys out of
my purse,start the car.
