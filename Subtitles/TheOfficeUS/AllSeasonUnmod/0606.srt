1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:02,318
The fundamentals of business.

2
00:00:02,443 --> 00:00:04,371
The fundamentals

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:05,498
of business.

4
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:08,758
Mental is a part of the word.
I have underlined it.

5
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:11,969
Because you're mental
if you don't have a good time.

6
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:13,304
You have to enjoy it.

7
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:15,691
The fun is in it.

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,809
- Fundamental.
- Right.

9
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:21,182
- Get out.
- I am.

10
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:24,870
Yes, so it all starts
with a handshake.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,152
But you can't just
go right to the selling.

12
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,277
You need

13
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,553
small talk.

14
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:32,698
What topics can you use
for small talk?

15
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,845
Golf, stock market.

16
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,827
- Dave Matthews.
- Yes, what else?

17
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,705
Small things...
Peas, ball bearings, dimes.

18
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,374
- The weekend.
- That's good.

19
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:44,383
Come on up.
Meredith, come up here.

20
00:00:44,508 --> 00:00:46,212
Let's do a little something.

21
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,712
So Meredith and I
have just started conversing,

22
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:52,112
and I will say, "So Meredith,

23
00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:54,410
"how was your weekend?
What did you do?"

24
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:58,096
I caught my son taking a dump
on the upper part of the toilet.

25
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:00,852
- All right.
- He calls it an upper-decker.

26
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:05,356
What you don't know about business
I could fill a book with.

27
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:06,942
- Then do it.
- What?

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,067
Write a book.

29
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,580
<i>The fundamentals of business</i>
by Michael Scott.

30
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,625
Over 1 billion sold.

31
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:19,103
More than the Bible.
I'm not surprised.

32
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:20,328
Chapter one.

33
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,691
The businessman...

37
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:53,585
Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott.
He's the person you should talk to.

38
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,310
I'm sorry, just a sec.

39
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,790
You're supposed
to be the gatekeeper.

40
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,161
Do you have any idea
how valuable my time is?

41
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:03,265
Your schedule just says nine till noon
is creative space.

42
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,939
- I thought this could be part of that.
- Do you know how creative space works?

43
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:08,794
Okay, I just canceled my afternoon.

44
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:11,255
You don't have anything.
It just says, "free play."

45
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,459
Push "free play"
till tomorrow morning.

46
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:15,884
Sorry, crazy day.

47
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:17,834
You're seeing
how the sausage gets made.

48
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,044
Come in the conference room,
and I will show you a finished sausage.

49
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,480
As a manager of business,
you got a lot of pride.

50
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:31,066
But you also got
a lot of responsibility.

51
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,779
None greater, perhaps,
than the need to be sure

52
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,064
that your small or large business

53
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:40,242
is secure
in the event of a covered loss.

54
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,700
There is nothing more insulting

55
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:49,558
to a great salesman than having
to listen to a bad salesman.

56
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,063
It's like a great basketball player

57
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:55,695
having to listen
to a bad basketball player.

58
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,265
Jim's gone on his honeymoon.

59
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,883
So I started borrowing his office

60
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:07,058
to fart in.

61
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:09,146
Then one day, I came in,

62
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:10,842
and I just stayed.

63
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,917
'cause this place is awesome.

64
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:14,718
It feels like home now.

65
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:16,593
Even better than my home.

66
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:18,428
My home sucks.

67
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,188
What do you think?

68
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:24,395
Think you're right.
Definitely looks suspicious.

69
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,775
And his southern italian heritage
raises some flags.

70
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:30,441
God forbid you...

71
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:33,251
Should have a fire in the warehouse.

72
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:36,672
Definitely.
All that paper burning up.

73
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:39,510
And the truck goes off
the side of the road.

74
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:41,428
- There's injury.
- I hear you.

75
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:42,805
The truck.

76
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,640
You will be hearing from me.

77
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,977
I can be very, very persistent.

78
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,186
Do your worst.

79
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,043
Great.

80
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,112
Would you look at that, people?

81
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:00,984
What an unpredictable world
we live in, huh?

82
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,051
- What happened?
- Nothing.

83
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:10,249
Once again, I am just thankful
that I am a paper salesman.

84
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,294
- Did he threaten you?
- Not everything is a threat.

85
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,463
- Mobsters are.
- There is no such thing as monsters.

86
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,871
- He drives an SUV.
- I knew it.

87
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:21,302
More trunk space.
Or should I say corpse space?

88
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,054
Guys, I drive an SUV.
Does that mean I'm in the mob?

89
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,769
No, not that by itself.

90
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:27,615
But look at all the facts.

91
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,708
He seems like a mobster.

92
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,814
When did we start talking about the mob?
The guy was trying to sell me insurance.

93
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,249
Mobsters have a front.

94
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:37,018
Sometimes it's selling insurance.

95
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,987
Sometimes,
it's waste management or sanitation.

96
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,713
Not all Italian-Americans
are in the mafia.

97
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:45,576
I think... He just seemed
like he was trying to sell me insurance.

98
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,996
"Buy my insurance,
or I burn your warehouse down."

99
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,275
He did talk
about a fire in the warehouse.

100
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:55,210
And he also vaguely threatened me
with testicular cancer.

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,130
Who else is here?

102
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,072
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon,

103
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:03,804
so there's not the usual balance
between sane and others.

104
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,529
Toby has mentally checked out
since June.

105
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:08,140
It's a very dangerous time.

106
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,252
The coalition for reason
is extremely weak.

107
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:13,981
Oscar says I checked out, huh?

108
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,359
All right, hey, hey, hey!

109
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,277
Calm down, calm down...

110
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,201
You lived in New York.
What do you think?

111
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,825
First of all,
there's no such thing as "the mafia."

112
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,803
What you have are specific families.

113
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,560
What's the guy's last name?

114
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:31,496
It is Grotti.

115
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,457
Boy. I mean, what?

116
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,460
John Gotti, you idiot.

117
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,754
It's a completely different name.

118
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,632
- So he won't get caught.
- It's pretty close.

119
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,917
What mobster would change
his name from Gotti to Grotti?

120
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,804
- It weakens it.
- No, I disagree.

121
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,540
"R" is among
the most menacing of sounds.

122
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:52,227
That's why they call it murder,
not "mukduk."

123
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,854
Too many different words coming at me
from too many different sentences.

124
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:58,778
- Lock your door!
- I'm not gonna lock my door.

125
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,422
It's Oscar.

126
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:07,473
I'm so sorry to be calling you
on your honeymoon.

127
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,427
<i>What is going on?</i>

128
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:11,199
It's Michael.

129
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:13,400
He thinks
he's being shaken down by the mob.

130
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:15,165
How do you usually handle this?

131
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,126
<i>We're in Puerto Rico, so...</i>

132
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,404
<i>It's Pam.
We're on our honeymoon.</i>

133
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:22,828
- Sorry.
- <i>Unless someone very close</i>

134
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:25,217
<i>is in physical danger,
you should not be calling us.</i>

135
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:27,265
You're right. Sorry.

136
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,577
It's from Grotti.
He's following up.

137
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:35,702
Already?

138
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,604
This guy is persistent.

139
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:39,729
"I feel...

140
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:41,563
"that you will regret

141
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:44,788
"missing this great opportunity
to be in business."

142
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:47,186
That's bad.

143
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:50,078
What are my options here?
Do I just ignore it or...

144
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:51,012
Right.

145
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:52,762
You heard him.

146
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:55,456
He's gonna burn the warehouse down
or run our trucks off the road.

147
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,169
I'm calling the police.

148
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,749
That is the stupidest thing
you could do right now.

149
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:02,755
He's right.

150
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,203
Cops can't do anything
until a crime has been reported.

151
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:07,438
Not only that,
but if they find out you snitched,

152
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:10,846
you get a dead horse's chopped-off head
in your bed.

153
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,520
- That's not gonna happen.
- That's an exaggeration.

154
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:16,228
- What am I supposed to do here?
- When somebody threatens you,

155
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,003
you give in right away.

156
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:20,596
You buy insurance from this guy
and get him off your back.

157
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:22,608
I was thinking
exactly the same thing.

158
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,099
Criminals are like raccoons.

159
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:27,029
You give them a taste of cat food,
they'll back for the whole cat.

160
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,387
The only way to defeat a bully
is to stand up to him.

161
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,576
Trust me,
I have bullied a lot of people.

162
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,495
- I don't know.
- Hear him out. This is interesting.

163
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,620
Here's what we do.
We meet him in a public place.

164
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:42,127
Ask him to lunch or something like that,
someplace where he can't be violent.

165
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:46,516
Let him know that you are not
the kind of guy that he can shake down.

166
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:49,468
You're stubborn.
You might even be dangerous.

167
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,638
I like this plan.
I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.

168
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,806
Hold on...

169
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,350
My plan is out.
We do it the hard way.

170
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:57,823
All right.

171
00:07:57,948 --> 00:08:00,176
I will meet with him.
But I am not going alone.

172
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:02,653
- You're gonna have to.
- We're right beside you.

173
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:04,336
What?

174
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:20,295
What are you wearing?

175
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,322
Who's Pat?

176
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:22,799
If I'm gonna back you up,

177
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:24,670
I need a weapon
without drawing suspicion.

178
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,463
And I have to justify it somehow,

179
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,715
so I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.

180
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,551
- Do you know how to use it?
- To change tires? No.

181
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:34,096
But... it's metal.
I could hit somebody.

182
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,264
Let's go.

183
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,975
- Should I change?
- You're wearing loafers.

184
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Forget it!

185
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:49,957
Take that thing off the table.
Please.

186
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:52,028
Then, I can't use it.

187
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:54,309
I'm just gonna hide it.

188
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,712
The bathroom checks out clean.

189
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:01,355
Nothing behind the toilet
except this roach motel.

190
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:04,232
You'll never kill it that way.

191
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,962
You want to separate
the head from the thorax.

192
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:08,706
Cool it.

193
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:10,286
There he is.

194
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,529
- Mr. Scott.
- Mr. Grotti, we meet again.

195
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:18,649
These are my associates.

196
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:19,933
Hi. Angelo Grotti.

197
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,311
- So...
- You got this table?

198
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,230
What's this, one of them half-booths,
can't decide what it is type of...

199
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:28,848
Waitress.

200
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:32,112
- We're gonna sit over here.
- That's fine.

201
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,540
<i>Hello, Mr. Halpert?</i>

202
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,832
<i>The identity theft department
at Capital One.</i>

203
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:49,847
<i>We've detected some unusual activity
on your credit card.</i>

204
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:52,377
Man, do you think it was stolen?

205
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:55,081
<i>First, would you mind
verifying your home address?</i>

206
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,871
383

207
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,082
Linden Ave.,

208
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:03,560
Scranton, PA.

209
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:06,230
<i>May I have the last four digits
of your social security?</i>

210
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,940
6650.

211
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:11,109
<i>Mr. Halpert, you're obviously not
in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</i>

212
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,378
Wait a minute.
Yes, I am.

213
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:15,280
<i>I'm going
to put a hold on your card.</i>

214
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:20,600
I think
that we should let the criminal

215
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,412
use the card a little longer.

216
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:23,976
<i>Very funny, sir.</i>

217
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:25,874
<i>We'll get you a new card right away.</i>

218
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:28,361
<i>Have a nice day.
And thank you.</i>

219
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:32,610
Shoot.

220
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,156
If you want to supplement
your coverage, we can do that.

221
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,845
If you want to replace
your current coverage,

222
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:41,341
all the better.
You seem like a nice guy.

223
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,724
He's not that nice.

224
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,992
That's true.

225
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:46,391
- That's very true.
- Shut up.

226
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:47,866
Have you decided?

227
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:51,072
I'll have linguini,
red sauce on the side.

228
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:54,444
If the sauce does not come on the side,
I will send it back.

229
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:57,567
I want garlic bread,
toasted, not burnt.

230
00:10:57,692 --> 00:11:00,142
If it comes burnt,
I will send it back.

231
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:02,997
And for you, sir?

232
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,657
I will have the gabba-gool.

233
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:06,158
The what?

234
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:09,154
The gabba-gool.

235
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,713
- I don't really know what that is.
- You know, gabba-gool.

236
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:17,301
- I don't have to have that.
- He's trying to say gabba-gool.

237
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,594
- I don't think that we have that.
- That's okay.

238
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,430
Bring him the gabba-gool!

239
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,209
I will have the spaghetti.

240
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,734
With a side salad.

241
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:27,999
If the salad is on top,
I send it back.

242
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:31,356
Why would you cancel
Jim's credit cards?

243
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,460
I usually can think
quick on my feet.

244
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:35,569
But they were so fast on the phone.

245
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,446
This constitutes identify fraud.

246
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:40,640
I wouldn't last in jail, Oscar.

247
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:42,115
I'm not like you.

248
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:44,810
What's that supposed to mean?

249
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:46,829
You don't know about jail?

250
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,991
You would love jail.

251
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,917
Why would I love jail?

252
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,085
Because...

253
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:54,764
You would love it.

254
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,527
I don't think our company actually needs
any more insurance.

255
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,296
So I am out.

256
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:04,876
Look closely, Michael.
I feel there's a plan here for you.

257
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,726
Maybe we have a plan for you.

258
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:09,811
How about you?

259
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:11,897
Maybe you can use
supplemental coverage

260
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,069
of some kind.

261
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:14,649
Anybody can get hurt.

262
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,194
You always think
it can't happen to you, and...

263
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:20,449
Think about it.

264
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,710
Excuse me.

265
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:23,950
Sorry to bother you.
Are you a mechanic?

266
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:27,496
My battery's dead.
I've got my kid. Can you help?

267
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,920
Yes, I can.

268
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,833
Come on, I'm sorry.
We're having our salads.

269
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,000
Come on. Lady in distress.

270
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:34,920
Go, go!

271
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,314
Sorry.

272
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:40,089
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

273
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:41,343
Do you need any help?

274
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,146
I'm sure
he can handle a simple jump-start.

275
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:45,555
Now come on. Sit down.

276
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:48,052
- He's a good mechanic.
- Sit down.

277
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,089
- Where were we?
- I don't...

278
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:52,812
He was trying to force you
to decide on a policy.

279
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:53,901
So we're...

280
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,763
- choosing a check up dental.
- All right. Put 'em down.

281
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,261
Black goes on

282
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:01,139
the red with the...

283
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,785
If we...

284
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,960
Positive...

285
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:07,434
It being a motor drive,
it's just probably...

286
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,394
down.

287
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,706
- He seems bad at this.
- You want to do this, Junior?

288
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,583
I didn't think so.

289
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,603
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,382
Kind of a long day

291
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:18,891
at the mechanic store.

292
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,243
- You got a leaky spark tube.
- What?

293
00:13:27,368 --> 00:13:28,968
So your car's totaled.

294
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:31,367
You're just gonna want
to get a refund on that.

295
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,437
Or my guy could do it.
He's great, but...

296
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,956
I can't do that for you.

297
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,659
I work exclusively

298
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,108
on motorcycles.

299
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,595
Now, if you could just sign
this letter of intend,

300
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,559
I'll bring this back to my boss,

301
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:49,161
and we can get this in motion.

302
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,584
You okay, Pat?

303
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,468
I was just thinking about how...

304
00:13:58,932 --> 00:14:00,331
I had this car, 'cause...

305
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:01,798
This Italian car.

306
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,842
And I was driving it,

307
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,227
and it kept telling me
how much it needed oil.

308
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:08,161
But I wouldn't give it any oil.

309
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:11,101
And then, one day, it exploded.
And it killed everyone.

310
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,851
And that's what I'm afraid of.

311
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,353
Aren't you a mechanic?
Why wouldn't you put oil in the car?

312
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,172
It was before my technical training.

313
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,227
Don't do it.

314
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:22,824
- Do it.
- Don't.

315
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:24,196
Just do it.

316
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:27,319
Look, Mike,

317
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:29,896
I don't know
what your friends are telling you.

318
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:32,638
But you have to decide for yourself.

319
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:37,206
They gonna take care of your things
if you die tomorrow?

320
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,099
I don't understand.
Why would you buy a policy?

321
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:46,622
It's just the cost
of a cup of coffee an hour.

322
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,691
You were man enough to back down.
I'm proud of you.

323
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:51,598
I had to make a snap decision.

324
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,017
It wasn't snap.
You were sitting there for an hour.

325
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,866
It was a lot of snap decisions.

326
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:58,049
Do you know
what snap decision means?

327
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:00,200
- It means like this.
- Just get in the car.

328
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:06,028
Thank God.

329
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:08,053
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

330
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:10,184
- <i>We're on a catamaran.</i>
- It wasn't easy.

331
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,970
I had to tell the hotel
that it was a medical emergency.

332
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:15,826
I chose massive coronary,
'cause you told me that your dad...

333
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,358
had a bad heart.
Listen, man.

334
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,400
I got a problem.

335
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,379
I think I'm in trouble with the mob.

336
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:24,356
Or a major insurance carrier.

337
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,559
<i>- That sounds bad.
</i>- I know.

338
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,980
And you usually can
get out of stuff like this,

339
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:30,595
so I'm turning to you, my friend.

340
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,472
<i>I'm gonna help you through it.</i>

341
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,183
<i>All you're gonna need to...</i>

342
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:37,849
<i>And then go to...</i>

343
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,318
- Are you...
<i>- And you'll be saved.</i>

344
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,899
What? Wait,
I didn't hear a thing you just said.

345
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:43,954
<i>Just a...</i>

346
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,412
<i>And then you'll be saved.</i>

347
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,696
I missed the important part again.

348
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,820
<i>And you'll be saved.</i>

349
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:54,887
Please, repeat what you're saying.
I can't understand you!

350
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:57,214
<i>Bermuda Triangle.</i>

351
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,189
<i>Please don't call again.</i>

352
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,217
Question for you.

353
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:21,102
I recently purchased
some insurance that I can't...

354
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:23,732
afford, given my present salary.

355
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:27,485
Is there anything accounting-wise
I can do to sort of make it all go away?

356
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,512
Accounting-wise, no.

357
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:31,655
But phone-wise,
just call up and cancel it.

358
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:37,412
What about this cash
for clunkers thing?

359
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:44,615
All right. It was a thought.

360
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:55,972
We have let Michael down.
And it's 85% your fault.

361
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,058
He's alive, so you're welcome.

362
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,904
Not on the inside, he's not.

363
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:01,619
Look at his life.

364
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:02,642
Broke.

365
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,017
Living in fear.

366
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:06,111
No friends, dead end job.

367
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,406
Some of that existed before.

368
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:10,195
Not the living in fear.
That's new.

369
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,946
You're right. That is new.

370
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:15,200
He's got to stand up
to this mafia guy.

371
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,522
- I don't see that happening.
- Me, neither.

372
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,854
Not the way things are now.

373
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:22,359
But what if Michael felt no fear

374
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:23,917
toward the mafia guy?

375
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:25,402
Are you saying...

376
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:28,713
that we surgically remove
the fear center from Michael's brain?

377
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,282
What is wrong with you?
I'm talking about convincing him

378
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:32,717
that the guy's not mafia.

379
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:34,469
That seems a little far-fetched.

380
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,181
More far-fetched than a mobster

381
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,556
walking into a paper company
for a low-level shakedown?

382
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,794
And that happened.

383
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,860
Incredible news.

384
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,365
Grotti is clean.

385
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:48,055
No, he's not.

386
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,285
He's just good.

387
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:53,530
Nothing sticks to him.
You still don't understand how it works.

388
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,909
What we're trying to say is
we made a mistake assuming he was mafia.

389
00:17:58,242 --> 00:17:59,744
I have a buddy who's a fed,

390
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,146
and we did a background check
on the guy.

391
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:03,873
His background is perfectly clean.

392
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,215
It's true, he's clean.

393
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,980
I have friends still on the force.
Checked with them.

394
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:10,949
Ran his fed friend up the flagpole
to make sure he wasn't on the take.

395
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:13,701
Turns out he's a lovely guy.
Sweetest guy on the force, really.

396
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,178
- Class act. Boy scout.
- But he acts like he's mafia, though.

397
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,305
He's trying to intimidate you
to close sales.

398
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,011
He's just a pushy salesman.

399
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,435
And he made us all look like chumps.

400
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,705
If there is one thing I hate more
than the mafia, it is a liar.

401
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:33,250
I wish the mafia would go out
and kill all the liars.

402
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,396
And bury them in my yard.

403
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,007
And I wouldn't tell the cops
a thing.

404
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,362
Not that I would be lying, <i>per se</i>.

405
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,880
But I would just get really quiet
all of a sudden.

406
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,162
<i>- This is Grotti.
</i>- This is Scott.

407
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:46,904
<i>Great, Michael.</i>

408
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:49,352
<i>I'm just finishing up
your paperwork right now.</i>

409
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:51,387
Really?
Is that supposed to scare me?

410
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:53,596
I thought you'd be pleased.

411
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:55,665
You thought wrong.

412
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,094
Because I am not pleased.
I'm actually kind of P.O.'d.

413
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,029
<i>- Why?
</i>- I think you know exactly why.

414
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:02,719
Because you were trying to scare me

415
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,851
- into buying insurance.
<i>- I don't get it. How was I scaring you?</i>

416
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:08,630
I think you knew exactly
what you were doing, and frankly,

417
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:11,357
I think you were being
a total and utter jerk.

418
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:13,214
You suck!

419
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,500
I won't buy your stupid insurance.

420
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,280
- Let's wrap it up.
- How about that?

421
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,698
The only person
that actually needs insurance is you

422
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:21,743
if you show your face
around here again.

423
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:25,538
<i>Michael, when we all calm down here,
maybe at some point in the future,</i>

424
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,174
<i>you change your mind,
why don't you give give me a call?</i>

425
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,299
Doubt it.

426
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,459
What a...

427
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:35,632
tool.

428
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:40,371
What?

429
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:43,641
Next time you look in the mirror,
you're gonna be looking at a guy

430
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,226
who stood down the mafia.

431
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:51,053
- What do you mean?
- We just told you he wasn't mafia

432
00:19:51,178 --> 00:19:52,695
so you wouldn't be scared.

433
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:57,654
- What?
- You successfully backed down the mob.

434
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,448
You made the mafia apologize to you.

435
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,568
You made the mafia be polite.

436
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:09,165
I should be mad at you, guys.

437
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,185
But I'm not.

438
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,504
So I looked him in the eye,

439
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,381
and I said, "Not today, Grotti.

440
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:17,693
"Not today.

441
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,092
"And not tomorrow.

442
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,746
"And not the next day
or the day after that.

443
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:23,992
"And you can tell all your friends

444
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:26,766
"that if I see them,
then they are already dead."

445
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:28,556
I said something like that.

446
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:29,602
Very close.

447
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,944
Just to be clear,
he backed down an insurance agent

448
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,398
from Mutual of Harrisburg.

449
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:34,399
Coffee.

450
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,318
Not from the kitchen.
Stop and shop.

451
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,572
If it's not stop and shop,
I send it back.

452
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,529
Large.

453
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:42,240
If it's a medium, I send it back.

454
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,204
If it's an extra-large,
I send it back.

455
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,932
- How do you return coffee?
- Go.

456
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:50,167
Any questions?

457
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,101
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

458
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:56,129
Is Jim there?

459
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,758
<i>Our credit card has been canceled,
and we have to deal with that,</i>

460
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,928
<i>and I really can't handle the fact
hat you're calling us here!</i>

461
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,403
That sounds good.

462
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,259
I'll let you go.

463
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,400
Tell Jim...

464
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:09,634
that I said "Hi."

465
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,775
<i>I will. I will, Kevin.</i>

466
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,105
<i>I will make that my top priority.</i>

467
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,558
They have no idea what happened.
