1
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,899
Are you
swallowing them whole?

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:10,841
You're eating them so fast,
are they even
touching your tongue?

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,934
Yes.

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,070
Why aren't you
having any, Angela?

5
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:17,344
Oh, I ate so many already
when no one was looking.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,350
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, right.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,815
My baby's dieting.

8
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:25,116
She wants to fit into
a special child-size
wedding gown for our big day.

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,488
Why do those exist?

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,026
It's from
my pageant days.

11
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:31,086
I was
Miss Tiny Mid-Atlantic Bride
when I was 10.

12
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,324
Probably heard of it.

13
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,263
Brownies, is it?

14
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,295
Pastry cubes
made of sugar and fat?

15
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,927
No, thank you.
I'll stick with my jerky.

16
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,198
So why'd you
come in here?

17
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,762
To socialize.
And inform.

18
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,208
Brownies!
I'm taking two,

19
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:48,270
so I can parcel them up
and eat them
at my leisure later on.

20
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,474
Much healthier.

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,777
You taking two?

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,478
Yeah, but one of them
is for Toby.

23
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,579
Yeah. Why don't you
send that to him
in Costa Rica?

24
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,181
I'm just gonna hand
it to him right now.

25
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,886
Okay, weirdo.

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,359
Why's that?
Why's that weird?

27
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,296
She said she was going to
give it to him right now.

28
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,890
She's probably going to
because they
sit next to each other.

29
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,696
Yeah, they used to.

30
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,730
Toby works here again.

31
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,397
Oh, can you imagine?

32
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,237
Oh, no.
You don't know.

33
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,936
I don't know. What?

34
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,502
You should probably
just meander back there,

35
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,979
take a look,
see if he's back.

36
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,277
Dare I?

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,339
(LAUGHS)

38
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,444
You know what?
I'm going to,
for old time's sake.

39
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,026
Great practical joke, Jim.
Got me to go to the annex.

40
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,030
Hi, Michael.

41
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,232
(SCREAMING) No! God!

42
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:52,304
No, God, please, no!
No! No!

43
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,270
No!

44
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,377
I blame the two of you.
This is your fault.

45
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,773
Michael, Dwight and I
were talking about this,

46
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,218
and we both don't understand
how you didn't realize
Toby was back.

47
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,482
I'm concerned
you may have brain damage.

48
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:40,652
You cannot expect me
to keep track
of all of my personnel.

49
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,663
There are a lot of people
here and a lot of different
shapes and sizes.

50
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:49,395
And there is nothing that
is even vaguely interesting
about the way that he looks.

51
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,936
So, I'm off the hook.

52
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,302
Maybe you cleaned your ears
too vigorously with Q-tips.

53
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,102
I know where this is going.
You hurt the temporal lobe...

54
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,836
I'm not going to stop
putting Q-tips
in my ears.

55
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,208
I don't care
how much it hurts!

56
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,610
Maybe I just block Toby
from my mind.

57
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,877
Oh, interesting.
Continue.

58
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,080
Like someone
who's molested.

59
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,221
Doesrt remember it
for years.
Toxic Shock Syndrome.

60
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,884
Maybe it's
Stockholm Syndrome.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,825
Maybe it's
China syndrome.

62
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,954
Could be any one of them.
It's a messed up world.

63
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,022
It is a messed up world.

64
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,958
But it's our messed up world.

65
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,945
Oh, come on!
Do you see this?

66
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,481
Disgusting.

67
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,449
MICHAEL: Look at him.

68
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,421
With his stupid face.

69
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,221
Stupid tan.

70
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,623
Yeah.
He looks great.
Well-rested.

71
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,860
No. He looks worse.

72
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,925
(PHONE RINGING)

73
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,634
Yeah.

74
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,837
WOMAN: David Wallace
is on the line for you.

75
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,642
Thank God. David, hello.
We need your help.

76
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,273
DAVID: Michael,
is everyone okay?

77
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,341
Oh, well,
I'm afraid not.

78
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:17,014
Toby Flenderson
of HR has made
a sudden reappearance.

79
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,718
I don't understand.
Is anyone hurt?

80
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,853
Not on the surface, no.
But I can tell
people are disturbed, David.

81
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,798
Michael, you texted me,
"911, call me."

82
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,664
Yes.
All in caps.

83
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,727
Do you know
what "911" means?

84
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,204
I learned a while back
that if I don't text "911,"

85
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,799
people will not
return my calls.

86
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,935
But now people
always return my calls,

87
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:43,244
because they think
that something horrible
has happened.

88
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,450
DAVID: Toby was hired back
because
he knows the branch,

89
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,216
he was available,
and I like him. Okay?
And that's that.

90
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,282
With all due respect, David,
this hardly seems
like a dialog.

91
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,156
That's because
it isn't, Michael.

92
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,328
Now, what I'm curious
about is how you were able
to go an entire week

93
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,367
without knowing
a member of your staff
was there.

94
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,369
I did not want to
go back to the annex

95
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,133
because that is where
Holly worked,
whom I loved.

96
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,400
Also, it's icky back there.

97
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,738
That's true.
People say it's icky.

98
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,473
Okay. I have to go.

99
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,071
David, wait.
No.

100
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,515
Is there no way
we can get rid of him?

101
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,051
Not without cause, Michael.

102
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,552
I have cause.

103
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,612
It is because I hate him.

104
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,489
You have to get
along with Toby.

105
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,753
No.
Yep.

106
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,816
I don't.

107
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,953
Goodbye, Michael.

108
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:34,957
Don't do that.

109
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:39,297
So, Tunes,
you still going to buy
your old mars place?

110
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,565
Yeah, I am. Wait.
How do you know that?

111
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,370
I didn't tell you that.

112
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,842
No, I was just
walking by your desk.

113
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,401
I saw some e-mails.

114
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,538
I got peepers
of an eagle.

115
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,603
That's really not cool.

116
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,671
So, Jim,

117
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,308
you're going to live
in the same house

118
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,649
that you used to
pee the bed in?

119
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,087
Yeah. I guess,
technically, Kev,
you're right.

120
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,351
Today's a big day.
Today's the day

121
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,622
that I show Pam
the house
that I bought for us.

122
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,787
Without telling her.

123
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,730
But it's my parents' house,
the house I grew up in.

124
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,165
And, yeah, I bought
it kind of impulsively.

125
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:12,966
I mean, the price was good,
and I was helping out my mom.

126
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,064
It's got shag carpets.

127
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,371
I mean,
you can't blame my parents.
It was the '70s.

128
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,606
And why would you want to buy
ugly wood from trees

129
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,411
when you can have paneling
and a painting
of some creepy clowns

130
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,851
that is apparently crucial
to the structural integrity
of the building?

131
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,217
She's gonna love it.

132
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,313
Right?

133
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,783
Could you guys
all do me a favor

134
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,760
and just not talk about
this until I tell Pam?

135
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:36,886
That'd be great.

136
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,591
You haven't told
the missus
about the castle?

137
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,292
You're in
for a spanking,
my friend.

138
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,892
Myself and my lady,
no secrets.

139
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,699
PHYLLIS:
Jim, don't listen to Andy.

140
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,399
I think it's so romantic.

141
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,633
JIM: Oh, thanks, Phyllis.

142
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,108
Bob bought our house without
consulting me and I loved it.

143
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,838
Yeah? You didn't mind
not choosing?

144
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,936
Oh, no. Not at all.

145
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,244
But Bob's so extravagant,
I knew
it would be spectacular.

146
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,183
There's a maze
in the back
like The Shining.

147
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,750
Where's your place?

148
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,652
It's on Linden Ave.,
by the quarry.

149
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,089
Cool beans, man.
I live by the quarry.

150
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,961
We should hang out
by the quarry and
throw things down there.

151
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,061
Definitely, we should.

152
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,827
OSCAR: "To whoever made
the microwave mess.

153
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,894
"The microwave is
a shared kitchen appliance.

154
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,439
"By not cleaning it up,
you are basically
telling whoever follows

155
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,031
"that their time
is less valuable,

156
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,169
"as they will have to
scrub out
your disgusting splatter.

157
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,941
"Sincerely,
Disappointed."

158
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,142
That is just obnoxious.

159
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,878
OSCAR: No kidding.
Yeah.

160
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,755
Wait, what?
The mess or the note?

161
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,916
The note.
So "holier than thou."

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,720
I liked it.

163
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,159
Don't you think
the person
who left the mess

164
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,287
is the obnoxious one?

165
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,887
No.

166
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,525
The note is way more
obnoxious than the mess.

167
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:53,095
"Sincerely, Disappointed."
Get off
your high horse, richie.

168
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,005
Just because
someone likes things clean
doesn't mean they're rich.

169
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,043
Nah. They're rich.

170
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,606
Yeah, I wrote the note.
Not ashamed of it.

171
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,741
I'm not proud of it.
It is what it is.

172
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,752
Everyone keeps asking me
if I wrote the note
on the microwave.

173
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,051
It was rude and condescending
and a little snotty.

174
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,316
I wish I had written it.

175
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,993
(READING)

176
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,237
The nerve!

177
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,173
You want to see some
real high-caliber acting?

178
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,045
Well, Mr. Kurt Russell,
you are about to be served.

179
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,843
Hey, Toby.

180
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,186
Great to have you back, man.
Seriously. Just...

181
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,318
Just a real pleasure
to see you again.

182
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,383
Thanks, Michael.

183
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,656
You're welcome.
Missed you.

184
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,062
Missed you
as part of our family.

185
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,329
Well, that's sweet.
I missed you guys, too.

186
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,502
So Costa Rica, that was...

187
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,603
Did you have fun?
That must have been fun.

188
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:09,205
Well, it was amazing,
really was.
Thanks for asking.

189
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,749
Beaches were pristine.

190
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:11,908
Nice beaches,
pristine beaches?

191
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,281
Yeah.

192
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,650
The whole thing was
incredibly cathartic.

193
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,916
Why'd you come back?
Why didn't you stay?

194
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,015
Well, it's actually
kind of hard
to meet people, I found.

195
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,719
I bet. For you.

196
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,319
And, yeah...
Plus, it was hot.

197
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,629
Hot. Why didn't
you get an air...

198
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,964
Should've gotten
an air conditioner
for yourself.

199
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,128
Are you
all right, Michael?

200
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,535
Yeah, I am. I am.

201
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,699
I tried. I tried.

202
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,909
I tried to talk to Toby
and be his friend,

203
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:44,575
but that is like
trying to be friends
with an evil snail.

204
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,349
I feel like
I'm dying inside.

205
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,884
I feel like
Neve Campbell
in Scream 2.

206
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,723
She thinks she can
go off to college
and be happy.

207
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,821
And then,
the murderer comes back

208
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,162
and starts killing off
all of her friends.

209
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,060
Learned a lot of lessons
from that movie.

210
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,605
This is just one of them.

211
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,339
Okay, just summarize.

212
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,309
Okay,
fireable offenses include

213
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,472
workplace violence
and sexual harassment.

214
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,573
That's it.
That's it, perfect.

215
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,379
We will get him
to hit on somebody,

216
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,044
and then we'll
catch him in the act.

217
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,111
I love catching
people in the act.

218
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,486
That's why I always
whip open doors.

219
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,581
Me, too.

220
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,989
Okay,
let's get this started.

221
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,185
Okay.

222
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,222
What are you doing?

223
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,559
I am the bait.

224
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,621
For what?

225
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,599
Men find me desirable.
No, no, no.

226
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,659
It's a good day, too.
I'm wearing my mustard shirt.

227
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,965
You're the bait for Toby?

228
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,235
No. For one thing,
he's not gay.

229
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,139
And if somebody
were to be bait,

230
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,407
it would be Jim
or Ryan or me.

231
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,106
Men find me desirable.

232
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,239
Yes.

233
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,382
Sure they do, Dwight.

234
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,885
When it comes down to it,
it's a health issue.

235
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,352
I should've written that.

236
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,821
Yeah.

237
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,823
Why aren't you as mad
or interested in this
as me?

238
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:05,694
Oh, totally.
Sorry, are we talking about
the microwave still?

239
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,198
Are you inching away
from me?

240
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,324
No.

241
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,164
Reach your arms out.

242
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,195
I'm always this close.

243
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,537
(SINGING) Pamtown ladies
sing this song
doo-dah doo-dah

244
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,769
Hello, Pam.

245
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,572
Jim, may I have
a moment with Pam,
please?

246
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,703
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

247
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,271
Yes. I just have to
take this call anyway,
so...

248
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,012
His mistress!
No, I'm kidding.

249
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,644
No one would
ever cheat on you.

250
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,188
You are
the complete package, Pam.

251
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,314
What do you need, Michael?

252
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,291
Okay, what I would
like you to do
is take this folded note

253
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,057
and deliver it to
Toby Flenderson.

254
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,622
I want you to just react
to whatever
this note elicits.

255
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,396
Do not read it
beforehand.

256
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,527
Can you do that for me?

257
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,002
Sure.
Good.

258
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,304
No, no, no, no, don't...

259
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,808
"Please hug and kiss me,
no matter how hard I struggle.

260
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,503
"I am too shy to tell you
that I love you."

261
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,103
Damn it, Pam.
You gave me your word.

262
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,179
You have a good day?

263
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,290
Hey. Hey, guys,
that's really
inappropriate.

264
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,061
What's up?

265
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,429
I got some photos
from Costa Rica

266
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,127
if you want to see them.

267
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,965
Yeah, yeah, I'll see them.
Cool.

268
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,403
Toby, can I see those?

269
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,941
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
You scared?

270
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:23,997
Okay, those are
fighting words.

271
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,065
You mad?
You mad at me?

272
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,668
I hope he doesn't
haul off
and just hit you.

273
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,304
Do you want to do that?
Do you want to hit me?

274
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,280
You want to punch me?

275
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,214
MICHAEL: He might do it.
I dare you to.
Punch him, Toby.

276
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,512
Come on.
Come on...

277
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,575
What's the matter?

278
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,245
Hit him.
Hit him, chicken!

279
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,687
Yeah, punch him.
Hey, hey.

280
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,281
Come on, Ryan.
Whose side are you on?

281
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,416
DWIGHT: Ryan, come on, man.

282
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,687
No, do it. Do it.
I dare you.

283
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,921
Punch him as hard
as you possibly can

284
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,292
in the face.
I dare you, Flenderson.

285
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,421
Not...
Not as hard
as you can.

286
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,692
Just a good,
solid punch.

287
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,790
Come on, come on.

288
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,267
I'm not going to
punch you, Michael.

289
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,998
Are you really not
going to punch him?

290
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,369
No, why would I punch you?

291
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,964
Son of a bitch.

292
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,611
Should have hit him, man.
The guy was asking for it.

293
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,653
Once in a lifetime, man.

294
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,956
"Hey, whoever
was bashing the first note,
grow up.

295
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,189
"The microwave is filthy
and no one here is a maid."

296
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,754
See? Someone
around here is sane.

297
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:24,228
"You are all a bunch of idiots
and privileged ass-wipes
who werert raised right.

298
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,431
"If I find you,
I'm gonna
knock your teeth out."

299
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,633
Yikes.
That's a little
over the top.

300
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,208
Their heart's
in the right place.

301
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,180
I thought you were
going to
parcel those out

302
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,585
through the day.
Would you stop it?

303
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,523
You haven't done
anything helpful all day.

304
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,759
There's still
one thing we can do
to get Toby fired.

305
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,232
What's that?

306
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,563
Frame him for using drugs.

307
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,565
Frame him?
Yeah.

308
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,405
It's illegal,
but everything they do
on The Shield is illegal.

309
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,742
I've never
framed a man before.
Have you?

310
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,475
No, I've framed
animals before.

311
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,177
I framed a raccoon
for opening
a Christmas present.

312
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,551
And I framed a bear
for eating
out of the garbage.

313
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,715
It just seems
awfully mean.

314
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,790
But sometimes,
the ends justify
the mean.

315
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,964
Punch you, Michael.

316
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:46,683
Hello.
I've seen you guys around.

317
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,151
I'm Michael Scott,
Dunder Mifflin.

318
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,881
How you doing?

319
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,021
So I guess you
know why I'm here.

320
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,256
I need to
purchase something.

321
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,059
Like a fridge?
No.

322
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,660
I wanted...

323
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,003
I wanted to buy
some weed from someone.

324
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,063
What?

325
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,302
Grass, weed.

326
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,073
What makes you think
we'd have weed?

327
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,172
I heard you were drug...
I heard you dealt.

328
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,820
Hey, just hold on
one second.

329
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,695
I'm not wearing
a wire, so...

330
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,560
Why would you
even say that?

331
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,656
Hey, it's going
to be $500.

332
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,325
How much?
$500.

333
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,632
It's a good price.
It's a steal.

334
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,898
How many pounds
is that?

335
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,564
LEO: It's two pounds.

336
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,609
I'm losing money
on this, man,
just give me the money.

337
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,666
Okay.

338
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,473
All right. Walk away,
walk away, walk away.

339
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,877
Hey, Pam? I just
wanted to let you know,

340
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,477
I'm totally on your side
with the whole
microwave situation.

341
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,180
Thank you.
I was just back there

342
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,689
to make some Cup-a-Soup,
the thing
is still a huge mess.

343
00:15:58,757 --> 00:15:59,815
I know.
Can you believe it?

344
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,826
Yeah, it's crazy.

345
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:06,024
But I guess the thing is,
at some point,
notes or no notes,

346
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,931
someone's going to
have to just get in there
and clean it up.

347
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,766
I guess that's why
we have a temp, huh?

348
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,640
Oh, no, trust me,
I would just
make it worse.

349
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,507
How would wiping it
with a paper towel
make it worse?

350
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,569
I would find a way.

351
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,171
You've seen things
clean before though,
right?

352
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,581
I... Pam,
I am hopeless
at that stuff.

353
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,312
Hi, Michael.

354
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,790
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

355
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,759
I forgot...
I forgot...

356
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,526
DWIGHT: (WHISPERING)
Yes. I repeat,

357
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,068
a drug dealer
is on the premises
of Dunder Mifflin.

358
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,434
His name is
Toby Flenderson.

359
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:51,066
And he recently returned
from a mysterious vacation
in Central America.

360
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,112
I have risked a great deal
to tell you this information.

361
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,512
My name is Andy Bernard.
Andrew Bernard,
that's my name.

362
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,050
See you soon.

363
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,052
Pervert!

364
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,554
Angela, I didn't
do that.

365
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,752
So is this what
they taught you
at your fancy art school?

366
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,692
Why would I draw
a penis on my own note?

367
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:14,199
Why do you wear bright colors?
For attention, Pam.

368
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,633
Everyone, I have
an announcement to make.

369
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,932
I'm the person
who put the first note
on the microwave.

370
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,606
But I did it because
it needed to be said.

371
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,872
Why did you hide
behind anonymity?

372
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,642
Because I was scared.
But if that's my only crime,

373
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,276
is it a worse crime
than leaving
a filthy microwave?

374
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,410
Amen.

375
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,510
Don't.
This is for real.

376
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,249
Just clean it up yourself
if it bothers you so much.

377
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,415
It's not my mess.

378
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,654
It would've taken less time
to clean it up
than to write all those notes.

379
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,786
That's not the point.

380
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,797
Listen, New York,
that might fly...

381
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,425
Why? Because
I went to New York
for three months?

382
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,435
That and the black sweater,
Manattan.

383
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,994
Okay, yes.
I went to New York,
everybody.

384
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,904
I'm not gonna apologize
for it.

385
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,466
I experienced more there
in one week than I experience
here in three months.

386
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,910
I love New York.

387
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,641
You know, I especially love
that people there
cleaned up after themselves.

388
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,809
Well, I work too hard
all day to be
maid here, too.

389
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,251
I got a mess to clean up
at home, plus
I'm a part-time maid.

390
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,652
And what about
the penises?

391
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,849
I thought those were funny.

392
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,790
I didn't do them, Phyllis.
OSCAR: It's the anonymity

393
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,691
that I find so cowardly, Pam.

394
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,753
Really? Can you just
get over that part?

395
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,994
Why should I?
You couldn't get over
the messy microwave.

396
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,493
What?

397
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:28,799
I can't do this.

398
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:29,966
Can't do what?

399
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,569
It's not fair to you
and it's really
not fair to me.

400
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,136
Wait, what are you saying?
I broke up with Darryl
so I could be with you.

401
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,547
That was your choice.
Don't put that on me.

402
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm just going
on a little trip.

403
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,441
Can I come?

404
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,782
It's not
that kind of trip.

405
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,846
I'm going to Thailand
with some friends
from high school.

406
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,322
Well, a high school.

407
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,291
And if I don't do it now,
I'll never get to go.

408
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,486
And I'll always
resent you for it.

409
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,529
You don't want me
to resent you, do you?

410
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,894
So you're dumping me?

411
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,865
Let's be adults about this.

412
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,764
Let's have sex
one more time,

413
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,463
and if you have
any extra cash,
that would be amazing.

414
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,132
Okay.

415
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,077
Hi. We received a call.

416
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,012
I don't know
anything about that.

417
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,279
We were tipped off
about a possible
narcotics situation.

418
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,376
Here?

419
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,045
Hey, Pam, hey,
I got this, okay?

420
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,055
Hello, officers.
Dwight Schrute,

421
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,852
former volunteer
sheriff's deputy.

422
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,825
Listen, I may have
inside information

423
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,125
that someone
is hiding drugs
in this very office.

424
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,700
Just pretend
like we're talking
until the cops leave.

425
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,234
Those are real cops.
Real guns.

426
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,471
Wonder what's going on.

427
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,774
Officers, I reveal to you
the perpetrator.

428
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,339
Hey, what is this?
Search his things.

429
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,941
Sir, could you
step away from
your desk, please?

430
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,543
Why?
Sir, please step away
from your desk.

431
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,746
Hey, what's going on?

432
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,448
You don't have
my permission
to do this.

433
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,218
They don't need
your permission,
Flenderson.

434
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,123
They've got
the company's
permission.

435
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,422
Hey, hey,
what are you...

436
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,689
Why are you doing this?

437
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,458
You know what?
I think this...

438
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,828
This is probably
a misunderstanding.

439
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,196
Don't search my stuff.
POLICEMAN: Sir.

440
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,599
I have a reasonable
right to privacy.

441
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,695
Save your whining
for the jury there,
Flenderson.

442
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,761
Yeah, let's just
cancel this, okay?

443
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,828
TOBY: Michael?

444
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,171
Sir, did you recently
return from a trip
to Central America?

445
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,267
Oh, my God.

446
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,333
I went to Costa Rica
for a few months.

447
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,073
MICHAEL: No, no, no.
That was legitimate.
What is going on?

448
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,774
MICHAEL:
That was totally legitimate.
Hey, check this out.

449
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,213
MICHAEL: Oh, God!
That is not mine.

450
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,978
Turn around please.
I have never
seen this before.

451
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,485
No, no, no, no, God!
What is going on here?

452
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,043
No, that's...
I don't know
what that is.

453
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,611
Do you have any weapons?
Of course not!

454
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,385
I bet he has nothing
to do with that.

455
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,550
That's mine.

456
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,650
No, Michael, no!

457
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,716
Yes, it's mine.

458
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,121
Some basil.

459
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:33,956
And salad dressing,
I think.

460
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,090
Salad dressing?

461
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,930
Yeah, it's a Caprese salad.

462
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,993
There's a little bit of
mozzarella right there.

463
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,035
Are you kidding me?

464
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,337
That's my salad.

465
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,807
So wait a minute.
There's no drugs?

466
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,865
POLICEMAN: No.

467
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,775
Oh, damn it. Come on!

468
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,814
We got a fake tip.

469
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:50,870
Wait, officers,
are you sure you

470
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,280
don't want to
interrogate him?

471
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,080
POLICEMAN: No.
You have laws
that protect you

472
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,676
in any kind
of interrogation.

473
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,517
Why don't you use them?

474
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,491
You must feel pretty good
about yourself right now.

475
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:07,021
I didn't put Caprese salad
in my drawer, Michael.
Did you?

476
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,297
Since when is it illegal
to put Caprese salad
anywhere?

477
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,334
You know, the police
could have been out there,

478
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,840
catching real criminals,
instead of here,
searching my stuff.

479
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,375
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

480
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,138
That's what
you're worried about?

481
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,772
You're worried
about the cops' time.

482
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:26,614
You think I framed you
and you're worried
about the taxpayer?

483
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,216
God!

484
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,489
Welcome back,
jerky jerk-face.

485
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,932
You said you were leaving,
and you made liars
out of all of us.

486
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:41,988
I did leave.

487
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,159
Yes, you did.

488
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,429
And then you came back.

489
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,768
Which makes you
the biggest liar
of history.

490
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,306
I don't see it
that way.

491
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,702
Do you want to
hear a lie?

492
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,767
What?

493
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,210
I think you're great.

494
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,145
You're my best friend.

495
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,513
Hey, do you mind
if we make a stop
on the way home?

496
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,054
Sure.
Cool.

497
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,727
What are we doing at
your parents' house?

498
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,559
I have a surprise for you.

499
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,895
All right. Ready?
Close your eyes.

500
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,593
And now, open your eyes.

501
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,765
Ta-da!

502
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,940
I don't get it.

503
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,136
I bought it.

504
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,312
It's ours.

505
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,552
Let's go inside.
I'll show you inside.

506
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,587
So if you can believe it,
I did it without a realtor.

507
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,889
Saving on
closing costs
is good.

508
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,761
And we can put
all the money
to de-shag the carpet.

509
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:52,233
Which I think will
help the color situation.

510
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,472
Yeah,
I am really sorry
about this.

511
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,034
I tried to move it,
but he is really
nailed in there.

512
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,547
Worried about
art theft, I guess.

513
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,106
A lot of art thieves
in this neighborhood.

514
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,217
This is the master bedroom,
but I'm actually
not allowed in here.

515
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,125
So, I'm still in the process
of converting the garage.

516
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,129
It's got great light
in here.

517
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:24,157
And I was thinking
it could be perfect
for an art studio.

518
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,410
Look, I know.

519
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,040
I bought this
without asking you.

520
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,848
And it doesn't look great.
I know that.

521
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:47,352
And if you really hate it,
I totally understand.
It's just...

522
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,757
I love it.

523
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,957
You do?

524
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,157
Yeah, I love it.

525
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,221
Really?

526
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,767
I mean,
you bought me a house.

527
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,961
Oh, my God.

528
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,594
You bought me a house!

529
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,138
Yeah, I did.

530
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,575
Do we have to sleep
in your parents' bedroom?

531
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,780
No. No, we'll just
board that up.

532
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,347
It'll be that
weird spare room
that people ask us about.

533
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,551
And the clown?

534
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,890
Yeah, I really
can't move him.

535
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,825
What is my perfect crime?

536
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,129
I break into Tiffany's
at midnight.

537
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:34,070
Do I go for the vault?
No, I go for the chandelier.
It's priceless.

538
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,299
As I'm taking it down,
a woman catches me.

539
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,602
She tells me to stop.

540
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,701
It's her father's business.
She's Tiffany.

541
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,110
I say no.
We make love all night.

542
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,308
In the morning, the cops come
and I escape
in one of their uniforms.

543
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,850
I tell her to
meet me in Mexico,

544
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,148
but I go to Canada.
I don't trust her.

545
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,485
Besides, I like the cold.

546
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,046
30 years later,
I get a postcard.

547
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,684
I have a son and
he's the chief of police.

548
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,660
This is where
the story gets interesting.

549
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:01,529
I tell Tiffany
to meet me in Paris
by the Trocadero.

550
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,090
She's been waiting
for me all these years.

551
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,760
She's never
taken another lover.

552
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,134
I don't care.
I don't show up.
I go to Berlin.

553
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,935
That's where
I stashed the chandelier.
