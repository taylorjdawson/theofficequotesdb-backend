1
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,602
The building's custodian is
on vacation for the month,

2
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:08,886
and Dwight is too chip to
hire a replacement.

3
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:10,918
So, instead,
we're living in filth,

4
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:12,430
but, not for long...

5
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:16,042
because I have created
the chore wheel.

6
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:19,170
Oh, yeah.
Can I spin first?

7
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:21,372
Well, it doesn't spin.
We'll just move the wheel

8
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:24,575
one notch each morning,
and you see what chore

9
00:00:24,577 --> 00:00:25,609
you get that day.

10
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,111
A wheel is supposed to spin.

11
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:29,180
Yeah, you know,
like "guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh

12
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:31,315
guh-guh-guh-guh-h-guh--"
- No, I'm familiar

13
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:32,650
with spinning.
It's just that wouldn't work

14
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:34,552
with the chore wheel
because people might get

15
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:37,121
the same chore--
- Yuck. Boring.

16
00:00:37,123 --> 00:00:38,823
All she talks about is chores.

17
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:42,293
A wheel wants to spin, Pam.

18
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:44,295
Spinning would be more fun.

19
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:49,266
[Exhales] Okay.

20
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,802
Okay, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

21
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:52,970
- Woo!
- Wow!

00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:56,574
- Spinning!
- Big money, big money.

23
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,409
Yeah!

24

Mug duty?

25
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:02,780
Yes, you clean all the mugs
in the sink.

26
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:04,315
This sucks.

27
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:05,783
Yeah, seriously,
it's like everything

on there's work.

29
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:09,620
I don't think you guys
understand why we're doing this.

30
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:11,689
- It's--
- Yeah, and I don't think

31
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:13,457
that you understand wheels.

32
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:14,959

35
00:01:19,198 --> 00:01:22,333
with the chore wheel.

36
00:01:22,335 --> 00:01:24,001
We've got prizes!

37
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:27,304
Ten bucks, candy bar,
manager for an hour.

38
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:30,941
But there are also penalties,
like no internet,

40
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:34,311
The one thing
that is not on the chore wheel

41
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:36,447
is chores, but they were right.

42
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:38,115
It's more fun this way.

43
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:41,285

00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:43,087
Ahh! Whoo!

- Tiny wheel!
All: - Tiny wheel!

46
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,925
- Tiny wheel! Tiny wheel!
- There it is!

47
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:51,095
The tiny wheel
actually does have chores.

48
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:52,863
It's so cute,
no one seems to mind.

49
00:01:52,865 --> 00:01:53,964
- Toilets!
- Aww.

Yep, Roy.

I think the only weird thing
about going

60
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,206
to your wife's
ex-fiancee's wedding

61
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,375
on a weekday at 8 AM

62
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:39,677
is that it's
your wife's ex-fiancee.

Thanks, mom!

00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:44,548
- Banana?
- Yeah.

I'm afraid
he's only gonna have hot dogs.

Oh, come on, not even Roy

will have hot dogs
at his wedding.

He wanted hot dogs.

Oh, Pete, you've got mail.

Really?
I got somethin'?

Well, it's addressed
to customer service,

73
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,866

a nice letter.

but Pam doesn't know.

00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:38,429
Um, actually I--
I did tell Pam,

112
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:41,398
and we decided no,

113
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,500
but then I decided
"yes, anyway,"

114
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:46,904
so I'm thinking there's another
conversation coming,

115
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:48,872
and it's hard to know
when that will be.

Um, you have diabetes, Stanley.

to pick a selfish charity?

Well, it depends.

I mean, sometimes I find out
things that are really sad.

Well, I got a buddy

that's a big time
local news producer,

Uh, is it Duncan?

He's looking
for on-air talent,

195
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,245
and he'd kill me
if I didn't get you on tape.

about being more

214
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,452
Because I happened
to answer a "help wanted" ad

had been for a CEO

355
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:02,423
Johnny Depp.

356
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,464
Uh, um, I was having
a separate conversation

357
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:12,433
with Kevin?

358
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,402
Uh, Johnny Depp.

359
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:16,437
Totally. George Clooney.
[Phone rings]

360
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,972
Mm-hmm.

361
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:19,207
Okay, I'll have one.
I have one.

362
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:20,541
[Overlapping chatter]

363
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:23,277
Where is the craziest place
you ever made whoopee?

364
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,413
Kevin, stop it
with that question.

365
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,682
Right?

366
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:30,051
And did you show them
the market-- yeah.

367
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:33,187
And what'd they say?

368
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:35,089
That's awesome. [Chuckles]

369
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,325
That-- aw, my God.
Wow.

370
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:39,160
It's not even real yet,

371
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:43,131
and I'm not gonna tell her
until it's real.

372
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,166
I think maybe
they're actually is something

373
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:47,502
I don't know about Jim.

374
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,777
Everyone, we have
a voluntary meeting

375
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,014
in the conference room
to discuss Erin's confidence.

376
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,782
Her body.
We're gonna talk about her body.

377
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:00,884
Good. Great job.

378
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,552
Andy made me his consigliere,

379
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:04,454
which means
assistant regional manager.

380
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:06,055
I guess he thought I'd be
into <i>The Godfather</i>

381
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:09,225
because I'm black.

382
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:10,994
Wrong!

383
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:14,264
I'm into <i>The Godfather</i>
<i>'cause I'm a cinephile.</i>

384
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,899
I like <i>Scarface</i>
<i>'cause I'm black.</i>

385
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:19,636
Erin has an audition
to be a newscaster.

386
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:21,137
All: - Wow!
- Woo!

387
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:23,773
- Uh-huh.
- Congratulations!

388
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:26,743
And I want her
to feel very comfortable

389
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:28,444
in her very sexy skin,

390
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:30,680
so everybody say
something that you like

391
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:31,981
about her body, all right?

392
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,950
- Darryl.
- Okay.

393
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:37,687
Um, I like Erin's hair.
Those are very pretty colors.

394
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:39,522
- Yeah, right?
- I'm sorry.

395
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,824
- This is for a news audition?
- Yeah.

396
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:44,327
Then why are we talking
about her looks?

397
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,996
Why not her credibility
or her reliability?

398
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:49,732
News flash, everyone--
the human race

399
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,734
finds attractive people
more trustworthy.

400
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:53,202
So sorry, Andy,
but for 20 years,

401
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:55,939
the most trusted man in America...
Walter Cronkite.

402
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,440
Cronkite was hot.

403
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,709
If I could go back in time,
I'd take that moustache ride.

404
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,411
Does Erin have any experience?

405
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,813
Has she taken
any journalism classes, maybe?

406
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:05,648
Has she done
the pageant circuit?

407
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,151
- No, I watch the news--
- She's gonna be amazing.

408
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:09,852
Look at her.
She's gonna light up the screen.

409
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:11,220
This is a first for me,

410
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:12,822
and I don't get a lot
of chances,

411
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:15,558
so I have to take them
really seriously.

412
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,361
I will do whatever it takes
to get the job.

413
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:20,997
- Whatever it takes.
- Yeah, I know, I heard.

414
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:28,237
This is it.

415
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,206
- Any questions?
- Is it gonna be numb?

416
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,909
No, it's gonna be
over before you know it.

417
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:36,646
Mm-hmm.

418
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:40,249
Afghan president Hamid Karzai
declared a new policy

419
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,985
of dollar days
throughout the country,

420
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:44,220
promising low, low prices

421
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:48,091
on all 2012 Kia Sentras
and Sonatas.

422
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:50,393
"Aren't you glad you waited?"
Karzai commented.

423
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:53,830
Um, where did you get
that story?

424
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:55,865
A little bit here,
a little bit there.

425
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:58,234
I bet you didn't think
I knew current events.

426
00:16:58,236 --> 00:16:59,669
I love it.

427
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:03,406
It's fantastic.
Now, tag it with your name.

428
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:05,174
For Channel 11 News,
I'm Erin Hannon.

429
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:08,044
Pause after news.

430
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:09,879
For Channel 11 News,

431
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,048
- I'm Erin Hannon.
- No, pause longer.

432
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,951
- That was a good one.
- Pause-- pause-- pause longer.

433
00:17:14,953 --> 00:17:17,053
Okay, build suspense.
Don't be shy.

434
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,822
Got it. [Clears throat]

435
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:23,826
For Channel 11 News...

436
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:31,801
What, it's--

437
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:32,802
- I'm Erin Hannon.

438
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:33,936
Okay, all right.

439
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:35,705
Great.

440
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:37,373
Some great stuff in there.

441
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,109
I can feel you looking at me.

442
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:44,947
Okay, well here's something
you don't know.

443
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:47,083
- A couple of weeks ago...
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:49,252
I ran into this guy
from my high school

445
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:51,721
who has just gotten divorced,

446
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:53,623
and he hit on me in the mall.

447
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,526
And I didn't tell you
because-- I don't know,

448
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:58,561
I felt embarrassed,
and I didn't know

449
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:00,396
if you'd be mad or worried,

450
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:04,500
but anyway,
I thought you'd wanna know.

451
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:06,569
That didn't happen.

452
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:07,970
You would've told me
right away.

453
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:09,839
Yeah, I would've.
[Chuckles]

454
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:11,240
What about you?

455
00:18:11,242 --> 00:18:13,776
Come on, there's
gotta be something.

456
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:16,245
Between your birth
and the last two days,

457
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:18,247
something you just haven't had
the chance to tell me.

458
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:22,385
Uh...

459
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:26,489
Just tell me.

460
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,958
God, give it up, Beesly.
You know me too well.

461
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,531
[Grunting]

462
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:47,577
[Grunts]

463
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:48,711
- Hey.
- Hmm.

464
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:51,547
Um, I knew
something bothered me,

465
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:53,082
and I finally figured it out.

466
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:54,383
What news producers
are gonna wanna see

467
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:55,985
is how Erin relates
to the other people

468
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:57,587
- on the news team.
- Oh.

469
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:00,756
The weird thing is Erin
is doing the audition alone.

470
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:02,024
Oh, God.

471
00:19:02,026 --> 00:19:04,894
Now, I'd say Clark
could be your co-host.

472
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:06,562
He's already doing camera.
[Scoffs]

473
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:09,899
Somebody who's already
got rapport with Erin, maybe.

474
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,067
I don't know.

475
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:13,202
[Grunts]

476
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:15,438
Hey, this is
for real this time.

477
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,873
[Grunts]

478
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,241
It's gettin' late.

479
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:22,778
Thought you guys
could use a little inspiration.

480
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,914
Oh, a movie.

481
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,983
- What is this?
- <i>127 Hours.</i>

482
00:19:26,985 --> 00:19:28,317
- It's about this guy who--
- No, no, no, no,

483
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,153
- no spoilers. Please.
- My bad, my bad--

484
00:19:30,155 --> 00:19:32,555
- No--
- You're right, okay.

485
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:34,023
Good night.

486
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:39,262
- Hey!
- Hey.

487
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:42,298
- Everybody.
- Yeah.

488
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,399
- Come in.
- All right.

489
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:44,534
- Come on in.
- [Gasps] Wow!

490
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:47,069
Thanks.
What are you doing here?

491
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,738
[Exhales] Sorry, man.

492
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,073
Andy thought Erin
need a co-anchor.

493
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:53,709
I'm his makeup guy.
My hands are tied.

494
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:55,745
[Sighs] The victim was released

495
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:58,548
from the hospital
with second-degree burns.

496
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,783
Oh, wow.
You know what they say, Erin?

497
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,218
If you can't take the heat,

498
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,354
get out of the kitchen.

499
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,223
Well, he tried to,
but the fire door was blocked.

500
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:09,325
- He sure did. [Chuckles]
- All right.

501
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:10,760
We got that.
That's a rap everybody.

502
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:12,128
[Sighs]
It's just-- you sure, Clark?

503
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,529
Yep, she's done.

504
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,298
No, I just--
I don't mean Erin.

505
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,868
I mean for me.
I didn't feel good about that.

506
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,369
Oh, no, we got it.
We got it.

507
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:22,939
Great! Let's get some food.
I'm starving.

508
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:24,540
I don't think we did get it.

509
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:28,110
I could do a couple more takes.
We could do it in close-up.

510
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:31,147
That might even be better
for editing.

511
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:32,782
Okay, I don't.

512
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,483
All right.

513
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:36,185
I'm hungry.

514
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:39,755
Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin
to get a burger or something?

515
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:41,857
- Yeah, whatever you say, boss.
- Okay.

516
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:42,959
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

517
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,060
- Okay.
- Great job.

518
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:46,662
[Clears throat]
So this is a single.

519
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:48,297
Hey, even this doesn't
work out for me,

520
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,499
I'm just glad I had
the guts to do it,

521
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,502
and maybe it'll work out
for Andy.

522
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:03,014
Oh, that is
absolutely revolting!

523
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:05,717
- Yeah.
- He is so good, though...

524
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,785
Yes.

525
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,653
The way he just
cuts off his arm.

526
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:10,355
If you like James Franco,
we really should watch

527

528
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:13,892
Well, he's a genius, you know?

529
00:21:13,894 --> 00:21:16,928
He was in graduate programs
at Yale, Columbia and NYU

530
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,463

- Whoop-de-doo.

531
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:19,831

532
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,299
Well, it doesn't
make you stupid.

533
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:22,934

Actually, it makes you

- Oh, stupid like you.

535
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:26,171
- No, like you.
- Like you.

536
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:28,640
- You're the stupid one.
Both: - You're the stupid one.

537
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:31,500
- You, you, you, you, you--
- You're the stupid one.
