00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:04,495
Hey, sport!

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,471
I heard someone
got engaged, you dog!

3
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:07,631
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,639
(GROANS) God!

5
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,074
Nothing can
hurt you now.

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,771
You're a man in love!

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,873
(DOOR CLOSES)

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,384
I was there,
and that dude
is not engaged.

9
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,386
I'm not a big believer
in therapy,

10
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,888
but I would go
into my own pocket
to cover his copay.

11
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,149
Big idea,
double wedding!

12
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,488
Me, Angela, you, Holly.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,925
No. We would never do that.

14
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,656
And if we did,
it would be with
Jim and Pam.

15
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,719
Yeah, we'd never
do that.

16
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:32,822
Yeah, so there you go.

17
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,662
Michael, I got
my bridesmaid's dress.

18
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:35,860
Wow, so quickly.

19
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:36,959
Yeah, and you said
I could get it

20
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,732
in any color I wanted,
so I picked white.

21
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,296
Michael, did you tell
your mom yet?

22
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,172
Nope. Nope, not yet.

23
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,505
Why not?
You wouldn't tell your mom?

24
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,067
You love your mom.
MICHAEL: Yeah, I do.

25
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,135
Call your mom, Michael.

26
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,477
Yeah, I'll call her
and tell her tomorrow.

27
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,645
ALL: Call her! Call her!
I don't wanna
do it in public.

28
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,813
All right,
I will call her.

29
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,589
She is going to
freak out!

30
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,681
Speakerphone!

31
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,782
Not...

32
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,917
(PHONE RINGS)

33
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:02,989
Thanks.

34
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,052
MICHAEL'S MOM: Hello?

35
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,392
Mom, I'm getting married.

36
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,454
No, you're not.

37
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,296
Why do you always do that?

38
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:12,627
Whenever I'm getting married,
you don't believe me.

39
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,408
Are you getting married?

40
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,800
No.

41
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,509
(LAUGHS)

42
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,034
Are you...

43
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,047
I'm not.
I'm not getting married.

44
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,181
Psych.

45
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,378
So I've returned
my bridesmaid dress

46
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,643
and it was on sale,
so I'm out
a hundred dollars.

47
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,980
And I'm out a fiancee.

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,713
Are those
the customer surveys?

49
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,553
Yeah, this is all of them.
Jim, Dwight,

50

Phyllis, Stanley,
Andy and...

51
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,860
It's the receipt
to my bridesmaid dress.

52
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:12,955
What's that doing there?

53
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,365
I'll take care of that
for you. Thanks.

00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:22,400
Kelly Kapoor
is our dusky, exotic,
customer service rep.

55
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,567
And once a year,
she will contact
our clients

56
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,842
and find out
how happy they are
with our sales people.

57
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:32,078
Sort of a "Kapoor's List."
Schindler's List parody.

58
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,347
That's not appropriate. No.

59
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,018
Those reports
affect our bonuses,

60
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,821
which is kind of
great for me,

61
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,556
because you wouldn't know
from looking at her,

62
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,961
but Pam's a gold digger.

63
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,932
PAM O VER EARPHONE:
Hey, New York ain't free.
Get back to work.

64
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,300
It's the world's
tiniest Bluetooth.

65
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,307
I found it in
a Japanese gadget store
in the Village.

66
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,172
I got one for Jim, too.

67
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,267
Jim, say something.

68
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,005
JIM: Testing, testing,
hello, everybody.

69
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,512
We wanted to stay
on the phone all day,

70
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,675
but the company has a policy
against
eight-hour personal calls,

71
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,685
so we're not
telling anyone.

72
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,778
Pam, what do you
want on your coffee?

73
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,289
Sprinkle of cinnamon.
JIM: Sprinkle of cinnamon.

74
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,483
I should go.

75
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,292
All righty, Dwighty,
let's see how you did.

76
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,022
Bring it on.
No.

77
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,256
Sorry.

78
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,087
Wow.

79
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,224
What does it say?

80
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,633
Dwight,
your feedback
is horrible.

81
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,605
That's impossible.
A number of your clients

82
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,575
found your personal style
abrasive and distasteful.

83
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,668
I sell more paper
than anyone.
No, no, no, no.

84
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,440
Wait, is this a joke?

85
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,709
I'm getting that
queasy feeling that
sometimes accompanies jokes.

86
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,114
Do I look like
I am joking?

87
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,482
No, but that's
sometimes part of it.

88
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,077
If I were joking,
you'd be laughing.

89
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,816
Do you look like
you are laughing?

90
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,154
Lmpossible to say,
I can't see myself.

91
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,284
You're not.

92
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,121
Yo, Tommy Tuna.

93
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,590
Did you get
your scores yet?

94
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:52,790
No.

95
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,823
I got mine,
they were really good.

96
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,159
I miss him.

97
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,493
You must be really proud.

98
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,401
Yeah, I'm pretty psyched.
Whoa!

99
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,962
That's my mug.

100
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,108
Sorry, I was just...
It was right here.

101
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,201
Right. Well,

102
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,509
it's mine, so
if you could pour it out
and get another one.

103
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,947
Okay, or maybe I could
finish the coffee
that's in here,

104
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,985
and you could use...

105
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,318
Snoopy! He's funny.

106
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,083
Don't give him Snoopy.
That's mine!

107
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,216
That is a great mug,
but it's not my mug.

108
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,560
That is my mug,
so give it back.

109
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,421
How can you even be sure?

110
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,627
That's my face on it.

111
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,359
Make the face.

112
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,127
I don't see it.

113
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,833
Dude, that is my face.

114
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,502
PAM: What was that?

115
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,545
Wow. That was Dwight.

116
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,006
He seems upset
about something.

117
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,408
Describe him exactly.

118
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,076
What color mustard
is his shirt,
yellow or Dijon?

119
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,915
It is spicy brown, actually.

120
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,249
What are you
mumbling about?

121
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,482
How was your meeting
with Michael?

122
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,648
None of your business.

123
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:52,713
Was it your scores?

124
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,022
These can't be
my scores, Jim.

125
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,553
For your information,
I'm being sabotaged.

126
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,655
Of course.

127
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,757
And I'm gonna
find that person
and punish them.

128
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,823
Absolutely.

129
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,370
Or you could just be
nice to your customers.

130
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:06,894
You're an idiot.

131
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,167
There's the charm.

132
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,334
Jimbo, let's do this thing.

133
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:12,833
That is me.
Wish me luck.

134
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:13,970
No way.

135
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,241
PAM: Good luck.
Thanks.

136
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,748
I didn't say anything.
I love you.

137
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,805
I love you, too.

138
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,318
What do you think
I'm saying to you?

139
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,353
I'm not talking to you.

140
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,519
I caught Jim
talking to himself
several times today.

141
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,853
What a loser.

142
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,857
Get a friend, loser!

143
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,160
Yeah, I'm looking at it
right now,
it's really gorgeous.

144
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,598
You guys do great work.

145
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:39,099
I found the best
"tentist"
on the East Coast.

146
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,400
He personally tented
Giuliani's first
and third weddings.

147
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,871
And I got him.
I got him.

148
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,506
Would you be able
to do the same design,
but with walls of gray?

149
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,576
And a top
that's gray, too?
Fabulous.

150
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,749
Come on.

151
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,120
JIM: What?
You, too?

152
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,419
Did my scores drop a little?

153
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,460

Jim?

158
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,900
Are we even sure
that's my file?

159
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,029
No.

160
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,867
Yes, I am sure, Jim, it...

161
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,035
Well, there's gotta
be an explanation.

162
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
I agree.

163
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,941
Yeah.
So, let's see

164
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,481
what we can find out
from reading.

165
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,375
Jim Halpert is
smudge and arrogant.

166
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,919
I think he means smug.

167
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,012
Arrogance.

168
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,113
Michael,
I'm just trying to...

169
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,886
And there is
our smudgeness.

170
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,791
I need a decent bonus

171
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,025
because I'm actually
in the process of
buying my parents' house

172
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,400
so that they can retire.

173
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,860
And if history
tells us anything,
it's that you can't go wrong

174
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,269
buying a house
you can't afford.

175
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,270
Pam doesn't know
about the house,
so it's a fun surprise.

I may not have done so hot

179
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,982
on my customer
reviews this year.

180
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,381
Maybe it's 'cause you
spent the whole year

181
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,014
flirting with
the receptionist.

182
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,116
Little bit. Worth it.

183
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,831
Here's what's going to happen,
I am going to have to fix you.

184

on a more personal scale,

185
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,961

form of management.

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,097
Jim, what is that called?

187
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,039
Micro-gement.
Boom. Yes.

188

Now, Jim is going
to be the client.

189

Dwight, you're going
to have to sell to him

hostile or difficult.

'cause I need paper.

Excellent,
then you are in luck,
because we are having

I am Bill Buttlicker.

203

Really?
That's your real name?

How dare you?

Be respectful, Dwight.
Please.
Yes, Michael.

Could you
hold on one second?
That's my other line.

208
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,810
What?
No, but I...
I'm on hold.

209
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,113
Hello? Yeah.

210
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,613
No. I'm just on the phone
with this stupid salesman.
He's so dumb.

211
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,590
Probably just
going to keep him
on the line forever

212
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,990
and not buy anything.

213
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,050
Okay.

214
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,618
It's up to you
to change his mind.

215
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,131
Sorry, that was
a family emergency.

That's private.

I'm sorry,
Mr. Buttlicker.

speak a little bit louder,

That is totally
inappropriate.

at the client.

I would describe
you as

and definitely difficult.

another chance.

Hello, Mr. Buttlicker,
how may we help you?

Michael, I like
the sound
of your voice.

247
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,610
You know what
I'm going to do?

248
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,316
I'm going to buy
$1,000,000 won'th of
paper products today.

00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,724
Thank you very much, sir.

you'll regret it.

You are the master.

There is one condition,
Michael.

254
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,561
Yes.
You have to
fire the salesman

255
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,657

so terribly.

256
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,929
Don't do it, Michael.

257
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,397
(WHISPERS)
It's a million-dollar sale.

258
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:38,801
So it's called
the Shangri-la Tent.
It's two stories, heated,

259
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,939
and it has a bridal suite
for my bridal sweet.

really tasteful.

married in a tent

Well, Nana Mimi...
Okay, look.

This tent is awesome,

266
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,329
and it's in high demand,

267
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,701
so I really think
we should put
a deposit down now.

268
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,966
Okay, fine.
You can have your tent,
but only if it's in a field.

269

That's what she said!

351
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,947
That's what she said!

352
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,510
Good one.

353
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,357
Hey. Sorry about Dwight,
by the way.

354
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,554
Yeah, he's weird.

355
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,688
Well, we all
handle it differently.

356
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,364
I personally choose
to handle it
like a normal person, but...

357
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,425
Okay.

358
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,937
Hey, how are you
and Darryl?

359
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,064
We're cool. Bye.

360
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,370
Bye.

361
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,376
That was weird.
What was?

362
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,073
Have you ever had
a conversation with Kelly

363
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,675
where she didn't
go on for 15 minutes
without taking a breath?

364
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,686
No, actually.
Did you do something to her?

365
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,377
I don't think so.

366
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,184
Well, something's off.

367
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,250
Hey, how's things?

368
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,420
All right.
Yeah?

369
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,485
Living in the moment.

370
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,054
Do you have
any reason to believe

371
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,224
that Kelly
would be mad at me?

372
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,666
I don't play
the politics game
anymore, Jim.

373
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,202
Can I tell you something?

374
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,703
I played it
full-on in New York.

375
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,240
I played it high stakes,
for keeps.

376
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,508
Made it to the top,
but look what it cost.

377
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,168
Can I tell you
what else I learned?

378
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,713
Wait, that's pretty weird.

379
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,770
What?

380
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,680
Well, Andy has
a mug just like that.

381
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,482
Yeah. Kelly gave them
out as party favors.

382
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,248
Remember? You got one.
No.

383
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,381
What party?
Her America's Got Talent
finale party

384
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,084
over the summer.

385
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,051
That's crazy. It was packed.
I thought everyone was there.

386
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,459
You were there.
I remember
you being there.

387
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,929
I wasrt, but thank you.

388
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,556
Hey, do you know
anything about this party?

389
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,191
Yes. I said you
definitely should go,

390
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,826
but you wanted
to visit me instead.

391
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,497
I can't be the only one
who didn't...

392
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,415
Dwight, let me see
your coffee cup.

393
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,515
No.

394
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,357
Is that it?
No.

395
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,655
Why? No.

396
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,891
Okay, I'm going to
assume that was it.

397
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,297
Here's the thing.
I think you're right.

398
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,565
I think it was Kelly.
I think she's mad at us
for not coming to her party.

399
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,905
Man, I knew it.
Who are her
co-conspirators?

400
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,065
Probably just Kelly.

401
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,132
Obviously. I knew it.

402
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,332
That's what I'm saying.

403
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,639
Yeah. What?

404
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,701
You were right.

405
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,906
I was right.

406
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,408
You were right.
I was right.

407
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,507
You knew it.
I knew it.

408
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,608
You knew it
the whole time, buddy.

409
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,084
I knew it
the whole time, buddy!

410
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,518
Wow!
DWIGHT: Yeah!

411
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,046
Right Dwight is loud.

412
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,613
Yes! I knew it!

413
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:26,916
Yeah!

414
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,555
Boom!
Kelly the whole time.
Let's get her.

415
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,995
No, no, no, no.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight.

416
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,157
Let's just
talk about this.

417
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,291
Get out of the way.

418
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,732
What's going on?

419
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,099
Why don't
you tell us?

420
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,461
Nothing's going on.

421
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,937
Let me
paint you a picture

422
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,236
of a little girl
from southern India,

423
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,402
who despite being welcomed
into this country

424
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:49,379
will now spend
the rest of her life in prison
for a crime she did commit.

425
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,472
Dwight.

426
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,074
I was informed
by these gentlemen

427
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,881
that the reports
that you filed

428
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,184
may not entirely
be accurate.

429
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,687
What? I don't know
what you are talking about.

430
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,986
This is the first that
I'm hearing about this.

431
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,084
Come on.

432
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,924
You juked
the stats, cupcake.

433
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,054
We called about
a dozen customers and

434
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,961
they all said
that they gave us
great marks.

435
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,624
MICHAEL: What's going on?

436
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,528
I love your tie, Michael.

437
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,639
Kelly...
I was raped.

438
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,410
You cannot say
"I was raped"

439
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,538
and expect
all your problems
to go away, Kelly.

440
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,014
Not again.
Don't keep doing that.

441
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,051
I'll give you
one last chance
to come clean.

442
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,519
Just tell me
what happened.

443
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,648
Okay, all right.
Okay, I did it.
All right? I lied.

444
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,852
Whatever, just fire me.

445
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,121
But you know what?
I did it because

446
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,355
you guys didn't
come to my party,

447
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,521
and you said
you would try to,

448
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,859
and then you
didn't even show up,

449
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,729
and so you're bad friends.

450
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,028
We have our confession.
I'm calling security.

451
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,467
Don't, don't.
Get away from that,

452
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,798
Dwight, please.

453
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,338
You know what?
She's got a point
about you, too.

454
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,772
You do have a problem
dealing with people.

455
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,998
See? I wasrt lying.

456
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,441
You were lying.

457
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,739
I was lying.
Yes.

458
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,473
Jim, Dwight,
please excuse us.

459
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,809
But I want to be here
when you fire her ass.

460
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,874
I will call you
when it is time.

461
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:10,356
I have an enormous
amount of trouble

462
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,261
trying to get people
to come to my place.

463
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,391
And I hate it.

464
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:20,338
I can't tell you
how much
leftover guacamole

465
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,034
I have ended up eating
over the years.

466
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,545
I don't even know
why I make it
in such great quantities.

467
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,103
Here's what
we're going to do.

468
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,308
We are going to
sit here for a while,

469
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,317
make it look good.

470
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,250
And maybe you should cry.

471
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,678
Can you make yourself cry?

472
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,744
No problem.

473
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,916
I think
you should do that.

474
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,151
(SOBBING LOUDLY)

475
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,889
(LAUGHING)

476
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,157
(LAUGHS)

477
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,598
Pam Beesly?

478
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,837
Hey. What are
you doing here?

479
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,970
Who's that?

480
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,343
It's Alex.

481
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,941
It's Pam.
I came to kidnap you.

482
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,146
There's free wine and cheese
at the Chuck Close
retrospective. Let's go.

483
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,689
That's going to be great.
Who's Chuck Close?

484
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,984
I love Chuck Close
and his
photorealist paintings.

485
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,322
But I have to work.

486
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,091
Well, actually,
there's something else

487
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,565
I'd love to
talk to you about.

488
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,467
Can we go somewhere
else to talk about it?

489
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,664
Okay.

490
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,306
That's it.
I want to talk to this guy.

491
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,602
Put me in his ear.

492
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,668
What's up?

493
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,302
I want to take a big leap.

494
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,941
And I want to tell you
that I think that
you should not

495
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,108
move back to Scranton.

496
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,208
Wow.

497
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,076
I want to make
a bigger leap here.

498
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,621
He is into you.

499
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,157
Why did you come to New York
in the first place?

500
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,852
Because they have
a great design program,

501
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,451
and I wanted to see
if I was any good at it.

502
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,429
And I wanted to
work on my art, too.

503
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,522
Right.

504
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,499
And that's why I think
you should stay here.

505
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,058
Because, I mean,
you really
just got here,

506
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,072
you know, and you
can't do New York
in three months.

507
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,701
You know, it has everything.
All the opportunity is here,

508
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,275
all the...
The whole art scene
is in New York.

509
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,169
You know, it would be nuts
to go back to Scranton

510
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,682
without getting to
fully experience it.

511
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,774
Jim's in Scranton.

512
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,910
I know, but...

513
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,012
All I'm saying is,
if there's even
a teeny, tiny part of you

514
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,252
that really wants
to be an artist,

515
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,954
then I think
you should stay here,
because you don't want

516
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,259
to wake up in 50 years

517
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,266
and look back
and wonder
what could have been.

518
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,994
And that is
the end of my speech.

519
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,437
I planned it all.
Anyway...

520
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,030
I will see you tomorrow.

521
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,202
I'll see you tomorrow.

522
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,284
Is that the
Matsahashi B-400?

523
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,985
The world's
tiniest Bluetooth.

524
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,852
May I?
Don't.

525
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,168
Congratulations on
choosing Schrute Farms
for your wedding.

526
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,932
No, we haven't
decided
on anything yet.

527
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,565
We're still
reviewing some options

528
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,165
and it's going to
come down
to the numbers.

529
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,872
Well, then,
why don't you look over
some of our materials,

530
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,607
while I describe to you
the Excalibur package.

531
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,676
In addition to
the breathtaking
natural beauty

532
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,812
and smell
of Schrute Farms,

533
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,119
I can promise you
that our grounds
can be catered

534
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,887
to fit your
exact specifications.

535
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,861
I will work tirelessly
for you
over the coming months

536
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,557
and be at your
constant disposal.

537
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:40,094
Please feel free
to call or stop by
any time of the day or night.

538
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,295
That's very generous.

539
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,671
Well, you,
my good friend,

540
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,834
have nothing more
to worry about.

541
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,276
This wedding
is officially
out of your hands.

542
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,576
Thank the good Lord. Deal!

543
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,706
Okay.

544
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,809
What are we
talking pricewise?

545
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,283
You already said,
"Deal."

546
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,911
Pay him
whatever he wants.

547
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,615
Can't argue with that.

548
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,485
Dwight,

549
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,263
you are going to
make us so happy.
