1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:05,036
This here is a radon test kit, I
will be putting them everywhere.

1
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:09,136
And, please dont throw these out.
<i>(Fingers Snapping)</i>

1
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:10,836
This is a radon test kit.

1
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:15,036
Please don't throw these out.

2
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,671
See them all over the office.

3
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,907
Toby has been leaving
radon kits everywhere,

4
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,670
Like he owns the place.

5
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:23,759
The first time I
threw mine away,

6
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:25,698
I thought it was an ant trap.

7
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,629
But I figured I'd
rather live with ants

8
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:30,032
Than with his
creepy little disk.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,465
The second time...

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,532
I thought it was one of those,

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,965
You know, the things you
turn over, and it moos,

12
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:37,433
Like a cow thing.

13
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,673
But upon closer examination,

14
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,212
It was another ant trap,
so I threw it away.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,887
And the third time...

16
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:49,695
I did it out of spite.

17
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:51,332
- Pfffttt!
- Come on, michael.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,536
You're interrupting.

19
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:54,372
You're kidding me? God!

20
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,873
You say radon is
silent but deadly,

21
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,176
And then you expect me

22
00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:58,680
Not to make farting
noises with my mouth?

23
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:00,416
What is this? - Please sit down.

24
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:01,584
You know, we're not
gonna die of radon.

25
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:03,153
We're gonna die of boredom.

26
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:04,321
Yeah!

27
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:05,357
Right?

28
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:07,395
And if I had a gun
with two bullets

29
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:10,066
And I was in a room with hitler,
bin laden, and toby,

30
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:11,869
I would shoot toby twice.

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,870
- No.
- No!

32
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:14,540
- That's not...
- Okay.

33
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,275
You were being really funny,
and then you went too far.

34
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,244
I would kill bin
laden and then toby.

35
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,781
- No, that's still...
- Mm-mm.

36
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,852
Okay, geniuses,
how would you do it?

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,221
Curve the bullet

38
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:26,627
<i>Like in my favorite james mcavoy film,
wanted.</i>

39
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:28,295
All that does is help
you shoot around things.

40
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,431
Is there a curtain
rod in the room?

41
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:32,769
- I don't know.
- How about make believe land

42
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:34,437
Has anything you want?

43
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:36,873
<i>Stanley, please.
This is serious!</i>

44
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:38,341
Is this the thing where
they use an icicle

45
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:39,709
So there's no evidence?

46
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:41,212
Yes. We stab toby through
the heart with an icicle.

47
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,347
Come on. The whole two bullet
thing is a red herring.

48
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:44,515
Here's how you do it.

49
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,384
You line them all up,
you take one bullet,

50
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:49,354
Shoot them all through the
throat at the same time.

51
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:50,921
Watch this.
Phyllis, you're hitler.

52
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,857
Come up here. Toby, you're toby.

53
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,558
Andy, you're bin laden. Line up.

54
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:55,892
I don't wanna do this.
Throats together.

55
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,394
toby, just do it!

56
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:59,030
- Toby, come on.
- God!

57
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:00,632
Ready? One bullet.

58
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,702
And...Boom!

59
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:03,870
Puuuhhh!

60
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:05,573
Puuuhh!

61
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:07,608
- Yeah, that works.
- That works.

62
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:10,312
Good work.

64
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:33,169
What flavors did you get?

65
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,671
It's so exciting, pam.

66
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,639
The eagles are doing
a theme of ice creams

67
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:37,907
In honor of turning 60.

68
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:40,210
"despera-dough.
Witchy-womanilla."

69
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:41,578
Why do they do this?

70
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:43,213
Do you want me to go
back to the store?

71
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:45,383
No, no, no, it's fine.
I was just commenting.

72
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,685
We gotta get these out,
open 'em up.

73
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:48,920
This is all for michael.

74
00:02:48,988 --> 00:02:50,421
Turns out his
girlfriend was married.

75
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,557
Yeah. And when michael
gets a broken heart,

76
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,059
This whole place
comes to a halt,

77
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:56,495
So we're just trying to
get out in front of this.

78
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:57,663
After his last breakup,

79
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:59,699
He ate 40,000 calories
in three hours.

80
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:02,035
Right, pam?
That's what pam told me.

81
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:04,505
Yeah. Or no--well--

82
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,006
I don't know. I'm sorry.

83
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,742
I was up all night with cece,

84
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:09,744
Otherwise I'd be running this.

85
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:11,278
That's okay.

86
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:14,481
You probably shouldn't keep
a baby up that late, though.

87
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,050
<i>We have mr. Bean playing in
the conference room</i>

88
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:17,684
<i>And the pink panther movie
in his office</i>

89
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:19,186
With half-hour shifts
to watch with him.

90
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:21,121
And we need bodies in
both these rooms, people,

91
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,123
So please sign up.

92
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,358
- He's coming.
- Oh. Okay.

93
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,427
Everyone, remember,
when he gets like this,

94
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:27,362
He will wallow if you empathize.

95
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,764
Keep conversations light

96
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:30,933
And if you get stuck and
you don't know what to do,

97
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,501
Make a random sound
effect, okay?

98
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:33,703
Farting noise, whatever.

99
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:34,771
Okay.

100
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,905
- Hey, everyone.
- No, toby!

101
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,440
- No! Out!
- Get out right now!

102
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,909
- Leave now.
- Leave. Get outta here.

103
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:40,578
- Please!
- Right now.

104
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:42,613
Oh, and if he makes a joke,

105
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,048
Just laugh it up,
no matter what.

106
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:45,516
Okay?

107
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:49,253
Morning, everyone.

108
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:50,955
Hey!

109
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,056
- Hey!
- Hey.

110
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:54,158
Hello. - Michael.

111
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:55,727
Nice tie or something.

112
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:58,262
Oh, thank you.
It's reversible, I think.

113
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:01,132
- That's hilarious.
- That's awesome.

114
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,566
You want some ice cream?

115
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:04,135
Oh--oh, wow!

116
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,003
Are those eagles' flavors?

117
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,573
Cake it to the limit.
That's my favorite.

118
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,774
I love that.

119
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:12,176
Too much for me
to have by myself.

120
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,078
Anybody wanna share?

121
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,813
Boi-oi-oi-oing!

122
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,916
Okay. Well...That's random.

123
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:22,454
I will dig into those later.

124
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:23,989
I don't follow this exactly.

125
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,291
Uh, "the descendants of any
replicants from this union

126
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,359
Shall have"--

127
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:29,328
Joint custody.

128
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:31,832
Are we talking about
your grandchildren?

129
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,033
- No.
- No.

130
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:34,435
Rather than spend
all day in court,

131
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,403
We've decided to
settle our dispute

132
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:37,605
Using a mediator.

133
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:38,806
It was an option spelled out

134
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:40,808
In our child-rearing
contract and...

135
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:42,910
- Alleged contract.
- Alleged?

136
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,379
I'm going to own your farm
by the time this is over.

137
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:47,048
Pff. Yeah, just try.

138
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:49,683
I will do legal jujitsu on you.

139
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,085
- Oh, yeah--
- gaah!

140
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:52,986
See? Don't even need
to make contact.

141
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:55,422
The law will do it.

142
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,590
So much of this is just
impossible to verify.

143
00:04:57,658 --> 00:05:01,060
Item five, point "b"-- uh,
the beet juice cleanse.

144
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:02,562
I'm doing it. You know I am.

145
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,263
It's disgusting!
How do we know this?

146
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,265
I'd like to see a stool sample.

147
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:08,100
Dwight, look at my teeth.

148
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:09,767
Eh.

149
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:11,569
No secret crying.

150
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:14,505
Hasn't even opened the
tissue box in there.

151
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:16,373
Could he still be seeing her?

152
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,874
I don't think he'd do that.

153
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,409
So we're gonna say the
most likely scenario

154
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:21,744
Is that michael
matured overnight?

155
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:24,113
<i>Well, it happened to tom
hanks in big.</i>

156
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:28,318
<i>Exactly. It happened in big.</i>

157
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,286
No, I gotta go. Text me later.

158
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:32,054
I'm really too tired to do this.

159
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,722
- Me too!
- Then let's just not do this!

160
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,825
Do you have any idea
the risks involved?

161
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:38,494
- Hey, michael.
- Hey.

162
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,029
We were wondering if
you'd like to have

163
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:41,897
Dinner with us
tonight in our home

164
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,232
And play with our baby.

165
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,333
We could order in from hooters.

166
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,769
Oh, hooters to go. Nice.

167
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:48,638
<i>We can watch a movie.
And play rock band.</i>

168
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:50,840
<i>- Billy joel rock band.
- That...Exists?</i>

169
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:52,108
Yes.

170
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:54,244
Okay, well, I'll have
to take a rain check,

171
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,413
But thanks for the offer.

172
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,814
Michael scott,
are you still seeing donna?

173
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,651
Okay, pam...

174
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,087
She's not invisible,
so stop asking silly questions.

175
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:06,589
Oh, michael.

176
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,491
Since when is this an office

177
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:10,959
Where we delve into each
other's personal lives?

178
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:13,862
I like donna.

179
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:16,397
Is it wrong to keep seeing her?

180
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:17,865
Depends on who you ask.

181
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,602
I mean, if you ask
her husband...

182
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,972
Or you took a random poll,
yeah, it's wrong.

183
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,607
That is something
I would never do.

184
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:26,675
Well, I think we all know

185
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:28,010
What you're capable of,
meredith.

186
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:29,812
Hey, I have never cheated on,
been cheated on,

187
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,447
Or been used to cheat with.

188
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,116
I ask...Everyone in the room,

189
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:38,355
"are you in a relationship?"

190
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:39,622
People, this is scranton,

191
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,023
And many people
consider that to be

192
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,126
The paris of northeastern
pennsylvania.

193
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,460
And in paris,

194
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,329
It is rude for a woman to
have less than four lovers.

195
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:47,330
Uhh! Ryan, I do not want you

196
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:48,331
Hanging out with
michael anymore.

197
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:49,765
Okay.

198
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,534
Okay, I will have you know
that I asked donna about this,

199
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:53,835
And she is fine with it,

200
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:55,770
And just to be sure,
I asked her again afterward.

201
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:57,772
Same answer. - How
does he feel about it?

202
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,574
He is never gonna find out.

203
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:01,543
He is a high school
baseball coach.

204
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,213
He wakes up early.
He goes to bed early.

205
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,649
Look at how long it took
for him to find out.

206
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:09,952
It was right under his nose.
I had to tell him!

207
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,654
Now you're just being hurtful.

208
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,956
I'm sorry, it-- why is it okay

209
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:16,292
For stanley to cheat
or for phyllis to cheat

210
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,728
- Hey--
- on...Her diet?

211
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:21,464
He's a sports guy. He's scummy.

212
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,932
Dogfighting, drugs. They spit.

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,100
Did donna tell you that?

214
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:27,802
<i>Real sports with bryant gumbel.</i>

215
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,237
So you're just making
a giant assumption.

216
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:30,905
You don't even know the guy.
You know what?

217
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:34,375
You know what? I am declaring
a moment of silence right now.

218
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:37,244
Ten minutes of silence
honoring michael jackson.

219
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:41,514
Just sit there and think
about michael jackson.

220
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:43,250
My name is andy bernard,
and I'm a cuckold.

221
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:45,485
For those of you unfamiliar
with william shakespeare,

222
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,255
A cuckold is a man whose
woman is cheating on him.

223
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:50,991
I've lived the part.

224
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:53,828
And let me tell you,
I would so much rather...

225
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:57,031
Play the part on stage.

226
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,867
So...Here's the thing
about infidelity.

227
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:01,602
Mm, no, no.

228
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,937
When are you people
going to stop casting

229
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,205
The first stone?

230
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:05,573
I am not in the wrong here.

231
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,041
I am the good guy.

232
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:08,943
How does that work?

233
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,847
Do you think this husband
is a super sweet nice guy?

234
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:15,283
Do you think he's an angel?
I don't think so.

235
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,784
Why is his wife going off

236
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:20,120
And having a little
something-something with me?

237
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:24,024
There has to be a
problem with him.

238
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:25,192
In any cheating movie,

239
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,794
The person getting
cheated on is the hero.

240
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,463
You're ali larter. I'm beyonce.

241
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,797
I am beyonce always.

242
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:34,099
- Not this time.
- Yes, I am.

243
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,067
This guy's a high school
baseball coach, right?

244
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:37,401
Let's go check him out,

245
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,536
See what a horrible
person he is.

246
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:40,304
- I would love that.
- Yeah.

247
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:41,772
Those teams have games
and practices every day.

248
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,241
Let's go check it out.
I have work to do.

249
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:47,111
Oh, really? I thought
you were the boss.

250
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:49,413
Let's go.

251
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,315
I can't wait to see this jerk

252
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:52,817
Who is making me
cheat on his wife.

253
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:54,118
Should punch him in the nose

254
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:56,720
For what he's
making me do to her.

255
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:02,676
<i>* bum bum bum bum *</i>

256
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:04,145
* bum bum bum bum *

257
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:05,579
* bum bum bum bum * - all right,
andy, please.

258
00:09:05,647 --> 00:09:07,314
- Baseball!
- Shh!

259
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:11,451
Try not to draw attention,
please.

260
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,618
That's him. That's him.

261
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,287
- Where?
- Right there. The coach!

262
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,989
Stage right or stage left?

263
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,423
<i>I played batboy in
damn yankees!</i>

264
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,924
Right there. Look, look.

265
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,926
Follow my finger. Okay? See?

266
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,594
The grownup by the base?

267
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:25,796
and now, coaching third base

268
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:28,099
With two arms, two legs,
and no heart.

269
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,968
Capable of feeling pain.
All right.

270
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,536
Can you just--

271
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,538
Can you just act normal
for a second, please?

272
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,675
Whatever.
I'm the one blending in.

273
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:46,286
Guys?

274
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,754
- Pam.
- Mm. Hey.

275
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:49,222
Oh, hi, gabe.

276
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,557
Can you two please
join me in my office?

277
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,727
Now.

278
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,166
You were supposed
to be the lookout.

279
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,567
Yeah. Well,
it's really warm in here.

280
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:02,469
It's like a sleeping bag.

281
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:04,071
I don't wanna be the heavy here,

282
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,174
But honestly, guys,
this makes us all look bad.

283
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:09,076
- Sorry about that.
- So embarrassing.

284
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,378
Good. Okay.

285
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:13,580
End of the dressing down.

286
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:15,481
I just hate that part
of the job, you know,

287
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,683
The power dynamics.

288
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,152
Well, you were
surprisingly restrained.

289
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,020
We will be well-rested tomorrow.

290
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,355
Okay. That's great, actually,

291
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,023
Because I wanted to talk to
you about something else.

292
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,725
Excellent. Go for it.

293
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,726
I'm sure you got my email
about the printer fires.

294
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,795
The one with the
branching decision tree?

295
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,230
I actually designed that chart.

296
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,099
Kinda hoping it catches on.

297
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,834
Anyway, the question is,

298
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,269
What is the best way

299
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:39,540
To disseminate important
information in an efficient way?

300
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:43,244
Right? So, uh, let's, uh...

301
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:44,578
Finally there's a provision here

302
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,914
In the occurrence that the
child is born an old man,

303
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:48,283
A la benjamin button.

304
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,984
- Same page.
- Same page. Go to the next one.

305
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,419
Just keep moving.

306
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,020
Despite the provision covering

307
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:54,722
Whether this is all
part of the matrix--

308
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,224
Which we can't know.

309
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,692
- This is essentially...
- Unless we're unplugged.

310
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,929
Equivalent to a donor
or surrogate contractor.

311
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:03,397
And wake up in the future.

312
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,766
Which is actually pretty common.

313
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:10,071
So I have to tell you that
this is a solid contract.

314
00:11:10,138 --> 00:11:11,172
What?

315
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,573
Look, I can't enforce

316
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:14,575
That anybody have a
child with anyone else.

317
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:16,577
- What?
- So essentially,

318
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:18,446
This comes down to damages.

319
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:22,417
Now, there is some precedence
for the range of $30,000.

320
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:23,618
What?

321
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,854
I don't have $30,
000 lying around.

322
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,689
I have it buried very deeply,

323
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:31,559
And I don't want to dig past
a certain someone to get it.

324
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:34,262
Chase dixon is up.
Could be a big play.

325
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,330
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

326
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:36,831
I know it's like cricket.

327
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,098
- You don't. No, no.
- And it's--there's--

328
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,267
Well, home plate
is like a wicket.

329
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:42,436
- You don't know. You don't-
- you don't know anything.

330
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:43,970
Look at him.
Look at him over there.

331
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:47,874
High-fiving?
He didn't even do anything.

332
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,910
Kid did all the work.
I bet he does that at home.

333
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:54,314
I bet it's like, "hey, donna,
why don't you wash the dishes?

334
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:55,782
"high-five, donna.

335
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,417
"hey, why don't you
bring me my slippers?

336
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:59,786
High-five. I'm taking
all the credit."

337
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,488
Seems pretty well
liked by the team.

338
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,125
Okay, well, that's because
he's paying their salary.

339
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:08,429
You do know that
high school coaches

340
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:10,131
Don't pay their players.
I know, I know, I know.

341
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,500
It--I'm--it-
that was a euphemism.

342
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:14,736
$30,000? There's
gotta be another way.

343
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:18,072
He has a 60-acre beet farm
that is worth a small fortune.

344
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,641
Look, I will not pay.

345
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:23,511
Well, I have an alternative.

346
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:24,845
"intercourse to completion.

347
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:27,148
Five individual times
rendered at my discretion"?

348
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:28,749
Look, I don't think
that's actually legal.

349
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:31,919
Agreed.

350
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,687
Five times for $30,000?

351
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:37,858
Not a bad stud fee.
Better than most horses.

352
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:39,793
But not in your bed. It's lumpy.

353
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:41,695
Those lumps are cats,
and those cats have names,

354
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:44,664
And those names are ember,
milky way, diane, and lumpy.

355
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:46,700
Fine. Five times.

356
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:48,369
Look, I can't legally
watch this unfold.

357
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,005
It's coming a little dangerously
close to prostitution.

358
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:53,007
- I want eye contact.
- No.

359
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:54,174
- Yes.
- Do you understand

360
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:55,309
How rare that is in nature?

361
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:58,379
I'm not some farm animal.

362
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:03,151
Great game, coach.
Shh! Okay, all right.

363
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:04,152
Don't--don't--

364
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:05,386
You guys are awesome!

365
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:07,822
Best game I've ever
seen in my life.

366
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,958
Yeah, right. You must be
rootin' for the other guys.

367
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:11,726
Ha. The other guys can go die.

368
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:13,061
- okay.
- Baseball!

369
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:15,496
Go talk to him. - No.
God. You go talk to him.

370
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:17,732
- Let's go.
- Shane.

371
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,968
Great game, man.

372
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:21,235
Do I know you?

373
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:24,505
No. Uh, just big fans.
Both of us.

374
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:26,507
Are somebody's...Parents?

375
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,475
Oh, are you guys...

376
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,077
Kenny's dads?

377
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:31,512
Ha. No. No.

378
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,182
But we're gay for baseball.

379
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:35,716
- Okay.
- But I have a wife, actually,

380
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:37,585
Who I really love a lot. - Okay.

381
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:38,753
Yeah.

382
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,788
I am so into the
institution of marriage.

383
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,156
Whoa!

384
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:43,925
I mean, isn't marriage
the best, you know?

385
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:46,060
Two good people
finding each other,

386
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:49,730
Getting all committed
to each other.

387
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:51,598
So you love baseball.
What else do you love?

388
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,233
Let's round you out as a person.

389
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,767
Hey, I'm really sorry,
I'm just trying to...

390
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,202
Focus here on the game.

391
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,603
I get it, man. I love it.

392
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,072
That's what makes
you a good coach.

393
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,273
You know, but as a fan,
it just helps me

394
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,377
Enjoy the game better if I
know the coach loves his wife.

395
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,046
Of course. Okay? I gotta...
Get back to this.

396
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,348
- Of course.
- All right.

397
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,516
But real quick, I want
you to meet my associate.

398
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,685
Sheldon! - No, no, no.

399
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,020
- Come on, get over here.
- I'm good.

400
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,521
Oh, my god. - Get over here.

401
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,790
Sheldon, say hi
to the nice coach.

402
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,258
Sorry. I got some
stomach cramps.

403
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,193
It's all right, all right,
just keep it going!

404
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,795
Well, that was not at
all what I expected.

405
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,731
Hoo hoo!

406
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,866
Whoo. My heart's still racing.

407
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:30,403
I just looked a man in the
eyes and I shook his hand.

408
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,738
All the time I was thinking,
"I'm sleeping with your wife."

409
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,508
And you know who does that?
James freakin' bond.

410
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:39,750
Okay, orange slices.

411
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:41,318
There ya go. - Thanks, michael.

412
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:43,787
Don't thank me.
Thank dylan's mom.

413
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,122
Here you go! Oh!

414
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,757
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo!

415
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:48,426
Why would you throw
something wet at me?

416
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:50,462
You love it. There ya go.

417
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,197
Now, were those for the team?

418
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:55,166
Uh, no, they didn't say team.
They just said coal hawks.

419
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:56,201
- Ah.
- I don't think those

420
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,402
Were yours to take.

421
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,037
Well, then it wouldn't
be the first time

422
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,872
I stole something
away from coach shane.

423
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,674
I just wanna go on
record as saying

424
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:04,509
That I do not
condone this affair,

425
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:05,978
And I even went so far

426
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:08,913
As to force michael to confront
the victim of his behavior.

427
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,382
- Did you talk to him?
- I did.

428
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,550
You talked to the man

429
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,586
Whose wife you're
having an affair with.

430
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:16,922
- Wow. That is crazy.
- Was there a fistfight?

431
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:19,524
No. We just talked.
He's very nice.

432
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:21,059
And it didn't change your mind.

433
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:23,094
- It did not.
- Michael, that's awful.

434
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:24,562
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

435
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,364
- I'm awful, aren't I?
- Yeah.

436
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:27,598
That's pretty bad.
I'm an awful guy! Ooh!

437
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,467
How can you live with yourself?

438
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,402
I am what I am, oscar.

439
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,404
And I want what I want.

440
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:35,807
And right now,
I want a piece of cake.

441
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,275
From now on, when I'm hungry,

442
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:39,478
I am going to eat
whatever I am hungry for.

443
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:42,481
That is a dangerous game,
friendo.

444
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,949
Well, because I thought
that it was a book

445
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:45,584
About anthropology the store.

446
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,553
I don't know why you were in
that part of the bookstore.

447
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,254
'cause it's next to the
baby section, okay?

448
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:50,522
All right,
that makes more sense.

449
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:51,823
You should have said
that at the beginning

450
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:53,391
When you said, " I read a
book about anthropology."

451
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,126
I don't really know why you're
screaming at me right now.

452
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:56,727
- I'm not scream-
- I'm not screaming.

453
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:58,829
That's meredith's cake.
It's her birthday.

454
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:00,297
I don't care.

455
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:04,067
I have an appetite for life!

456
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:05,935
Mmm.

457
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:07,437
Mmm! Oh, god.

458
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:09,172
That's lemon.

459
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,908
Good for you, man.

460
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:14,745
Good for you.

461
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:20,518
He takes what he wants.

462
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:23,421
You know what?

463
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:26,024
I think you're attractive,
and I wanna sleep with you.

464
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:27,493
What about kelly?

465
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,194
You read my mind.

466
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:30,862
is this a joke?

467
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,066
Yep.

468
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:36,701
It's hard to live that way, man.

469
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:39,004
You gotta really not care
what people think about you.

470
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:40,739
I-I don't know how
you do it, michael,

471
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:43,908
I-I-I can't be that cold.

472
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:46,111
You'll learn, baby.
You'll learn.

473
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:55,820
I am an honorable man,
and I will honor the contract.

474
00:16:55,888 --> 00:16:58,157
But I don't have to
give her the good stuff.

475
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,658
Schrute sperm are strong,

476
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,494
But they're no match for
a grown schrute man.

477
00:17:02,963 --> 00:17:04,997
let's see what she gets.

478
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,467
aah!

479
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,238
Uh, boss, we're out of paper.

480
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:14,106
- Yeah, I noticed that.
- Are you gonna add any more?

481
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:15,740
Nope.

482
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:18,109
He don't give an
"f" about nothin'!

483
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:21,078
I have got big balls.

484
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:23,347
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

485
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:25,515
what about an energy
drink or something?

486
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:26,782
It gets in the breast milk.

487
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,117
If I drink it, cece
drinks it six hours later.

488
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,419
Well, it doesn't mean
I can't drink it.

489
00:17:30,486 --> 00:17:31,720
Well, it does and it doesn't.

490
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:33,688
Probably shouldn't
tell you this,

491
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:36,525
But a lotta guys
in the warehouse

492
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:40,029
Work multiple jobs,
so... We have a place.

493
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:42,765
- A place?
- A restful location.

494
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,401
Talk to glen. He'll
take you up in the lift.

495
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,804
You sleep in the warehouse?

496
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,940
Lightbulb's burnt out,
so it's dark.

497
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:53,042
And the heat from
the backup generator

498
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,910
Keeps it nice and warm.

499
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:56,078
Sometimes I think about it

500
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:58,080
When I'm trying to
fall asleep at home.

501
00:17:58,148 --> 00:18:00,249
But as far as the rest
of the office goes,

502
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:02,718
It doesn't exist, okay?

503
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:04,153
- Okay.
- Pam.

504
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:06,055
Okay.

505
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:08,724
- For your signature.
- Okay.

506
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,434
Phyllis.

507
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:20,837
Okay. Look at me.

508
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:23,039
Phyllis, look at--

509
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:25,675
Okay, that's...

510
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:27,010
All right, all right.

511
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:29,712
You know what? I'm sick of this.

512
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,515
I'm sick of the little
disapproving head shakes.

513
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,250
If you think that's going
to have any effect on me,

514
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:36,485
It will not.

515
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:38,020
I am going to leave right now

516
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,622
And go to a motel to meet donna.

517
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,291
Why not your condo?

518
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:46,060
Because a motel is
dirty and it is sexy.

519
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:49,030
Like me. And like donna.

520
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:51,032
And frankly,
the stuff that we're into

521
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,433
Isn't very condo-appropriate.

522
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,436
Oh, michael, will you drop it?

523
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:55,804
Everybody's spoken their mind,

524
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,138
And no one's
changing their mind.

525
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:59,374
Okay, morgan
freeman-narrating-everything.

526
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:00,909
Do you want someone to stop you?

527
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:05,681
'cause no one's going to.
Nobody better try to stop me.

528
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:07,450
Good.

529
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:10,152
I could have stopped him.

530
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,525
- Are you warmed up?
- No.

531
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:22,128
God, angela, why is that
always my responsibility?

532
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:24,364
What did you do to yourself?

533
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:26,299
Never mind. Just never mind.

534
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,601
- Well, it better work.
- Oh, it'll work.

535
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,037
Mm. Stop kissing me.

536
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,006
It's not in the contract.

537
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,678
How do I feel about
breaking up with donna?

538
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,349
Good. Moral. I feel proud.

539
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,852
like a grownup.

540
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,190
That was not easy because
I really liked her a lot.

541
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,024
And I'm a little bit
emotional right now

542
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:29,361
Because I know that I absolutely

543
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,762
Made the right decision.

544
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,233
At the end of the day,
we have to do what's right.

545
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,669
And it was either
living with myself

546
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,171
Or...Being happy.

547
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,842
And I picked...

548
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,711
The...

549
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,714
Former.

550
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:55,809
- Michael scott?
- Yes?

551
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:57,944
Do you wanna make a
comment on the rumors?

552
00:20:58,011 --> 00:20:59,912
um...

553
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,379
I have done some
very bad things,

554
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,279
Things of which I am not proud.

555
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,779
I would like to publicly apologize to..

556
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:011,979
the coach and the players.

557
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:017,600
and I vow to never listen to

558
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:019,579
my bodily instincts ever again.

559
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:023,679
I am talking the Sabra printers
that catch on fire.

560
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:027,979
Oh! ok. I was talking about the..
What the.. What's going on?
