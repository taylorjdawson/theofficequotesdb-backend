1
00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:05,824
Coat!

2
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,727
<i>Michael just rent The Devil wears Prada.</i>

3
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:12,506
He has his netflix
sent here to the office

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,877
and he watches them in pieces
when things are slow.

5
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:18,015
Steak!

6
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:21,774
Where's my steak?

7
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:24,520
He's a big Meryl Streep fan,
so I shouldn't be surprised

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,480
that he's identified with her character.

9
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:28,086
Get me Armani.

10
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:29,456
A suit?

11
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:30,722
On the phone.

12
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:33,003
The main company number?
'Cause I'm gonna have to...

13
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:34,255
Where's Armani?

14
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:36,198
He's on the phone.
Too slow.

15
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:38,117
You're not going to Paris.

16
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:40,393
I'm so much better than you are.

17
00:00:54,318 --> 00:00:55,551
I owe you an apology.

18
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,594
- You finished the movie.
- Yeah, it was awesome.

19
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:00,681
Big surprise ending.
Won't ruin it for you.

20
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,318
No, go ahead.

21
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:05,639
Meryl Streep is the bad guy.
You never see it coming.

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,691
Anyway, if I was mean
in any way to you, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:14,581
I just want what's best for you,
Minushka.

24
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:21,277
Macushla.

25
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:23,430
<i>He's watching Million Dollar Baby.</i>

26
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,217

<i>Episode 4x04
"MONEY"</i>

63
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:04,461
So this one goes with my eyes
and this one goes with your eyes.

64
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,608
People said I have very pretty eyes.

65
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:08,707
- You do.
- I haven't heard the same about you.

66
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:10,489
So let's just go with mine.

67
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,246
Well they both go
with the carpet that I've ordered.

68
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:16,048
And if we go with the brown
leather sofas, they go with that too.

69
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:18,850
- We already have a sofa, so why d...
- A futon's not a sofa.

70
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,679
It folds up.
You've only seen it flat.

71
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,011
- I know what a futon is, Michael.
- I... Okay.

72
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:25,452
How much is it gonna cost?

73
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,621
- It costs what it costs.
- No...

74
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,187
- It doesn't even mean anything.
- We've gone through this.

75
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:31,294
Yes!

76
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,533
Money has been
a little bit tight lately.

77
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:35,624
But at the end of my life,

78
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:38,103
when I'm sitting on my yacht,

79
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:40,434
am I gonna be thinking
about how much money I have?

80
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:45,326
No, I'm gonna be thinking about
how many friends I have

81
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:48,740
and my children
and my comedy albums.

82
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:53,645
I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously
did pretty well, money-wise.

83
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:58,267
It's just, you know,
you say it's gonna cost what...

84
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:01,135
<i>- Yeah?
- Michael, it's Ryan for you.</i>

85
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:03,053
Conniving little runt...
Put him through.

86
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,309
Put him through.
Yes? Ryan, my man!

87
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:09,749
<i>- I email you about the new Powerpoint.
- Yes, thanks for sending that to me.</i>

88
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:12,610
<i>I had I.T. install the updated
Powerpoint on your computer</i>

89
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,983
<i>so you can use it for the presentation.
I really want people use Powerpoint.</i>

90
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,229
Okay, yeah.
No, I don't know.

91
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:20,521
I don't know.
I think those I.T. guys messed up.

92
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,699
<i>- Hold on, I get them on the phone.
- Wait, no, here it is... Found it.</i>

93
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,630
Sure, I can hold.

94
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:29,144
Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute.

95
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:30,504
Please hold.

96
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:44,678
Schrute farms.
Guttentag.

97
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,129
How can help you?

98
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:48,807
Yes,
we have availability on those nights.

99
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,681
How many in your party?

100
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:53,771
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
No king beds.

101
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,147
No queen either.

102
00:03:56,934 --> 00:04:00,557
We make our own mattresses that
don't conform to the traditional sizes.

103
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:02,737
Closest would be twin.

104
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:05,266
Thank you so much for calling.
Call back again.

105
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:06,708
Auf wiedersehen.

106
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:11,830
- Hey Dwight.
- None of your business, Jim.

107
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,458
- You running a bed and breakfast?
- It's not a B & B.

108
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:17,675
Agro-tourism is a lot more
than a bed and breakfast.

109
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,980
It consists of tourists
coming to a farm,

110
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,740
showing them around,

111
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:24,470
giving them a bed,

112
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:26,415
giving them breakfast.

113
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:31,953
- Department of Health know about this?
- I am not telling you anything.

114
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:33,746
Permits are pending.

115
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,929
Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.

116
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,232
- I'm looking for a room.
- Okay, this is a misuse

117
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:39,654
of company phones.

118
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:42,194
It says here you cater to the elderly.

119
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:44,681
- Where did you read that?
- Trip Advisor.

120
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:50,244
Trip Advisor is the lifeblood
of the agro-tourism industry.

121
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:53,415
A couple of bad reviews there,
you may as well close up shop.

122
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:55,539
That's what took down the Stalk Inn,

123
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,085
one of the cutest little asparagus farms
you'll ever see.

124
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:01,338
How many in your party?

125
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,036
Two.

126
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:05,676
We offer our tours of the fields
and of the barn.

127
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:10,722
Perhaps you'd be interested
in Mose's table-making demonstration.

128
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,569
So, I forgot to tell you
that I need the car tonight.

129
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:16,687
Actually, I need the car.

130
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:18,647
Why?
For improv?

131
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:20,732
Why don't you just

132
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:22,868
pretend that you have a car?

133
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:24,820
Good practice in case you ever

134
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,281
do a scene where you need
to pretend you have a car.

135
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:28,956
Used to have two cars.

136
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:31,380
Tred 'em in.
Now we're down to one.

137
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,507
Good economic sense.

138
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:36,204
Although the new car's a Porsche...

139
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:37,364
For her.

140
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,366
One cardigan.

141
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:42,767
One sleeping cardigan.

142
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,302
One sleep apnea mask.

143
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,424
What about my cherub figurine?

144
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,765
You took that with you.

145
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:55,149
No, I left it on my night tab...

146
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,394
Your night table by the lamp.

147
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,032
You are incorrect.

148
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,208
I was recently scrubbing my room
of memories and I didn't see it there.

149
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,241
Fine.

150
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,529
My girlfriend and I broke up recently

151
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,112
and I must say I am relieved.

152
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:12,117
Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats.

153
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,871
In the Schrute family,
we have a tradition where

154
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:20,000
when the male has sex with another woman
he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats

155
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:22,405
left on his doorstep by his parents.

156
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,359
You can use those oats
to make oatmeal, bread...

157
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,361
Whatever you want.
I don't care, they're your oats.

158
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:31,220
The bar uses an applause meter.

159
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:33,524
That is why it is so important

160
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:38,477
that you all come and applaud
only for my band, Scrantonicity 2.

161
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:42,522
Not Scrantonicity,
which I am no longer a part of.

162
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:46,526
- Michael, can I count on you?
- You cannot, I have a thing tonight.

163
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:48,459
Damn it.

164
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:53,170
- What?
- That reminds me.

165
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,325
If the invitation still stands, Pam
and I would love to have dinner tonight.

166
00:06:58,288 --> 00:06:59,248
Oh, no.

167
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:01,294
I've a thing tonight.

168
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:03,460
- That stinks.
- Darn it.

169
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:04,670
Shoot.

170
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,938
- How about this weekend?
- No, can't.

171
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:10,962
We only had tonight free and
we really wanted to spend it with you.

172
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,856
Damn it to hell!

173
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:16,265
- All right.
- What do you got going on tonight?

174
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,253
You wouldn't understand.
It's a secret.

175
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:22,569
I wouldn't understand or it's a secret?

176
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:24,064
You wouldn't understand, Jim.

177
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,643
It's a secret.

178
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:36,268
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien.
I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner.

179
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:38,017
I just have a very exciting offer.

180
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:42,143
My records indicate you've expressed
interest in losing some weight.

181
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:44,254
What if I told you that I have a pill

182
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:46,860
that will make you 50 pounds lighter
in five minutes?

183
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,269
How would that sound?

184
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:49,455
Amazing, right?

185
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:52,806
Well,
it won't be that fast but it will...

186
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,129
It will be that easy.

187
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,766
I can't believe this place is real.

188
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,667
I'd heard about his beet farm for years,

189
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:04,710
- but I never thought...
- The beets motel.

190
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,329
The beets motel?

191
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:09,151
- That is...
- Thank you.

192
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:11,612
Borscht Hotel.

193
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,240
The Embassy Beets.
Radish Inn.

194
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,660
- How are you doing this?
- I don't know.

195
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,491
Oh, my gosh.

196
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:36,702
I just love sales.

197
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:38,668
I love it to death.

198
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:40,465
It's as simple as that.

199
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:44,940
And I don't get to do enough of it
as a manager, so I took this second job,

200
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,300
kind of as a hobby.

201
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,555
Some people have golf or...

202
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,200
relaxing.

203
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,997
- What's going on here?
- Hey, I just got off the phone

204
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:57,147
and I was gonna make another call.

205
00:08:57,964 --> 00:09:00,829
We're a legit operation with a license
from the city. I can show you.

206
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,991
We pay minimum wage against commission.

207
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,512
They're with me, so...

208
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:08,369
This is Nick Figaro,
manager to the stars.

209
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:11,911
We have three rooms,
each with a different theme.

210
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,207
What are the themes?

211
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:16,294
America, irrigation, and night time.

212
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:18,963
- Irrigation.
- Yes.

213
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,189
I'll put you down for irrigation.

214
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:24,802
Now then, do you have any special needs
or dietary restrictions?

215
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,472
Yes, we will be requiring
a bedtime story.

216
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,341
No.

217
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:31,809
- Not even Harry Potter?
- Jim, come on.

218
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:34,461
- But you promised.
- Mose, bags, now.

219
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:42,153
Here we are, irrigation room.

220
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:43,754
A very special room.

221
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,494
So I'll come get you
before the table-making demonstration.

222
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:50,638
And as of this morning, we're completely
wireless here at Schrute farms.

223
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,205
But as soon as I find out

224
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:54,895
where Mose hid all the wires,
we'll get that power back on.

225
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,101
All righty.

226
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,900
Everybody in the conference room
in five minutes.

227
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,866
These meetings are useless.

228
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,865
I just want to remind you
to stick to the script.

229
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,644
Been proven to work.
So...

230
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,122
make the call,

231
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:17,917
say the lines,

232
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:20,400
make the sale.
Got it?

233
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:22,468
Very inspirational.

234
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:29,117
We're offering a $50 bonus tonight
to the guy with the most sales, okay?

235
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,515
- Or woman.
- Or a trained seal.

236
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,539
You can make jokes
when you've made a sale there, rookie.

237
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:35,704
Okay?

238
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:44,674
I'd say one in six.

239
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:46,714
What?

240
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:50,490
I thought you asked me what are chances
were of being murdered here tonight.

241
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,543
You know, I just realized

242
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:55,661
this is Pam's
and my first night away together.

243
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,778
I used to play it over in my head
and it was just a little bit different.

244
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:02,544
Maybe a...

245
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,819
nice hotel or a romantic dinner.

246
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,121
Wine...

247
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:09,699
but wine that wasn't made out of beets.

248
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,846
Didn't think Dwight
would be involved at all.

249
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,010
And...

250
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:16,706
I always imagined less manure.

251
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:18,471
I mean, some manure.

252
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:20,546
Just... less.

253
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:22,846
This is beet food.
Mose, what are you doing?

254
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:25,287
No, Mose!
Put the... Put the manure down.

255
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,619
Put it down.
Do not throw it! Do not...

256
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:30,032
Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?

257
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:31,458
<i>Yeah, who is this?</i>

258
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:34,506
Well I'm just calling
because you responded positively to...

259
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:38,134
Stanley?

260
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,081
Why are you calling me here at home?

261
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:44,182
<i>Señor, are you happy
with your long distance, sir?</i>

262
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:45,776
<i>Michael, I know that's you.</i>

263
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:48,033
<i>Why are you calling me here at home?</i>

264
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:49,455
Have you con...

265
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,534
Have you considered
satellite television?

266
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:53,956
<i>Michael, I know that's you.
I know your voice.</i>

267
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:56,492
<i>- All right.
- Why are you calling me here at home?</i>

268
00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:01,071
<i>When I'm at home at night
in my own house in my sweats,</i>

269
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:03,746
<i>drinking some red wine,
watching my mystery stories,</i>

270
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:06,492
<i>the last thing in the whole
godforsaken world I want to hear</i>

271
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:08,716
<i>is the voice of Michael scott.</i>

272
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:10,650
Your son sounds like
he's really motivated.

273
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,618
I think it's crazy
that the coach won't play him, frankly.

274
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:15,862
My office.

275
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:17,022
You bet.

276
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:20,686
Just dial the number on the sheet
and stick to the script.

277
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:22,906
Say the words exactly.
Got it?

278
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:25,182
I don't know
why we keep having this conversation.

279
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:29,315
Look, I know sales and I had that sale.
I just needed a few more minutes.

280
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:31,210
A few more minutes
is a waste of our time!

281
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,459
- It's not a waste of time.
- It's a trading game.

282
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:36,482
You give a quick pitch.
You make the sale and move on.

283
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:39,163
- That's how Vikram does.
- He doesn't have my people skills.

284
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:41,624
Good for Vikram
'cause he out-sells you every night.

285
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,796
Well, I hope
this conversation has helped.

286
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:53,178
"And Harry saw
"the white hand raise its wand

287
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:55,747
"and felt Voldemort's surge
"of vicious anger.

288
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:58,877
"Saw the frail old man on the floor
"writhe in agony.

289
00:12:59,037 --> 00:12:59,957
"Harry.

290
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:02,422
"It was over as quickly as it had come.

291
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,904
"Harry stood shaking in the darkness,
"clutching the gate into the garden,

292
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:07,358
"his heart racing."

293
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:11,796
What did you get tonight?

294
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:15,575
Oh, it looks like mixed marsala,
eggplant, and rice.

295
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:17,130
Oh, that looks good.

296
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,996
And what about you?
A peanut butter flavor again?

297
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:24,212
I am going
with the vanilla crisp this evening.

298
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:26,961
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

299
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,021
I was a surgeon back home.

300
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:33,259
- Really?
- Yeah.

301
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,076
- Wonder what I would've been back home.
- This is your home.

302
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:39,607
I know, but I mean,
it's so competitive here.

303
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,070
What's the dollar worth in your land?

304
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,814
Medical school must've cost,
like, 40 bucks or a donkey or something.

305
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:48,648
No.

306
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,352
I would've been chief of surgery.

307
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:57,998
Or a cowboy.

308
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:06,160
- Wait, you're going out there?
- Yeah.

309
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,376
Coward.

310
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:25,507
Oh, my god!

311
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,547
What century is this?

312
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,411
<i>Here's the thing about Die Hard 4.</i>

313
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:33,394
<i>Die Hard 1, the original,</i>

314
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:37,008
John McClain
is just this normal guy, you know?

315
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:42,030
He's just a normal New York city cop
who gets his feet cut, he gets beat up.

316
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:45,416
<i>But he's an everyday guy.
In Die Hard 4,</i>

317
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:49,335
he is jumping a motorcycle
into a helicopter in the air.

318
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:51,909
You know?
He's invincible.

319
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:53,817
<i>It's just sort of lost from Die Hard 1.</i>

320
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,220
<i>It's not Terminator.</i>

321
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,760
Dude, you should review movies.

322
00:14:58,257 --> 00:14:59,956
Oh, my god, yes!

323
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:02,735
- Yeah, you should!
- I actually wrote a movie.

324
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:04,388
- Really?
- Well I'm writing one.

325
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:07,513
- What's it about?
- Sort of spy thriller.

326
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,539
Hey, what's so captivating?

327
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:13,256
I love captivating things.

328
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:17,205
And this must really be captivating
because it's keeping you off the phones.

329
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:20,788
I mean, time is your money.
That's how I know how captivating it is

330
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,351
because of how much time
you've spent talking.

331
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:30,710
He returned.

332
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:48,374
Come in.

333
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:50,519
Did you have another nightmare?

334
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:03,573
- I thought you were Mose.
- Does Mose have nightmares?

335
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:05,211
Oh, yes.

336
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:07,224
Ever since the storm.

337
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,169
Is everything satisfactory
with your stay?

338
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,093
Yeah.

339
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,902
- Yep.
- Great.

340
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:21,156
Just that I'd heard crying or...

341
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,952
moaning or something in here.

342
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,894
Well I'll look into that in the morning.

343
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:34,212
Thank you for bringing that
to the attention of the staff.

344
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:37,749
Good night, Dwight.

345
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:56,499
Hey,
so we're all gonna go out for a beer.

346
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,740
- You wanna come?
- We'd love for you to come.

347
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,282
Thanks, no.
I've to work in the morning, so...

348
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,175
- All right, next time.
- Okay.

349
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:04,379
See you guys.

350
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,404
Hey, how are you doing?

351
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:10,786
You drive.
I had too much wine.

352
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,156
Okay.

353
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:15,532
- How was yoga?
- I didn't go.

354
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:18,417
- Why? Why not?
- I just didn't.

355
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:21,249
How was improv?

356
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:25,510
- Good night, Vikram.
- Night.

357
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,628
- Congrats on the bonus.
- Thank you, Michael.

358
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:29,233
I'll nab it one of these nights.

359
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:32,049
If you concentrate
and make your calls faster, yeah.

360
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,055
- Good night.
- Good night.

361
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:50,706
- Morning.
- Hi.

362
00:17:58,848 --> 00:18:00,494
Hey Dwight, how are you?

363
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:01,796
Pam.

364
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:04,790
You okay?

365
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,960
I'm better than you have ever been
or ever will be.

366
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,053
Hey guys what's happening?

367
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:17,510
How's my favorite branch doing?

368
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:20,764
Michael, why don't you start us off.

369
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:24,768
That wasn't much of an introduction.

370
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:28,647
Ladies and gentlemen,
your boss Michael scott.

371
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,375
Still lame.
Okay.

372
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,027
All right...

373
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:38,512
Thank you, Ryan,
for that wonderful introduction.

374
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,273
Okay...

375
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,619
Today, we're going to be talking...

376
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:46,873
about...

377
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:49,211
Powerpoint.

378
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:54,086
Powerpoint, Powerpoint, Powerpoint.

379
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:56,240
Yes, I forgot about Ryan's presentation

380
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,680
and yes, it would have been nice

381
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,658
to do well with the first presentation
that he'd given me.

382
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,106
But you know what else
would've been nice?

383
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:05,600
Winning the lottery.

384
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:10,267
And the best way to start
is to hit "start".

385
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,901
And up comes the tool bar.
That's what she said.

386
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:17,988
What we have to do here

387
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:19,906
is go to "run".

388
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:21,309
And then,

389
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:24,256
you look up to...

390
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,687
Powerpoint

391
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:31,085
and we are in.
We are going to register.

392
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,865
You hit "register".

393
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:35,990
"Updates are ready."
I should update.

394
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:41,428
"Estimated time 12 minutes."
So it should take about 5 or 7 minutes.

395
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:44,211
Is this the first time
you've opened Powerpoint?

396
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:45,329
Why?

397
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,048
You didn't prepare it, did you?

398
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,828
Know what? I had really rough night.
And my boss can back me up on that.

399
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:53,356
- I'm your boss.
- My other boss, Mr. Figaro.

400
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:55,066
You've another job?

401
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:59,379
What I do beetween 5:30 pm and 1:00 am
is nobody's business

402
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,656
but mine and my other businesses.

403
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,283
Are you a cocktail waitress?

404
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,821
You cannot have a second job

405
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:08,747
- if it affects your work here.
- It won't.

406
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,332
- It did already.
- Okay.

407
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,903
Honestly,

408
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,545
it is unlikely
that I was gonna figure this out anyway.

409
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:20,252
- You're so funny.
- Why is Darryl here?

410
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:22,260
- He works in the warehouse.
- I invited him.

411
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,722
It's not a party. Darryl, downstairs,
this isn't information you need.

412
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:29,582
This information here?
Yeah, you're right. I don't need this.

413
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:34,988
Hey, come on.

414
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:38,693
- See you later tonight.
- I got plans later.

415
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:40,172
Okay, bye honey.

416
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:48,716
How long to get this presentation ready?

417
00:20:48,876 --> 00:20:50,392
Why don't you do the presentation?

418
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:53,110
- I mean, you know how to do it.
- What I really want...

419
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,961
honestly, is for you to know it
so that you can communicate

420
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,426
to the people here,
to your clients, to whomever.

421
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,340
What?

422
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:02,717
- It's whoever, not whomever.
- No, it's whomever.

423
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:04,886
No, whomever is never actually right.

424
00:21:05,188 --> 00:21:06,471
Well, sometimes it's right.

425
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:09,563
Michael is right. It's a made-up word
used to trick students.

426
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:13,433
No, actually whomever is
the formal version of the word.

427
00:21:13,593 --> 00:21:16,523
Obviously, it's a real word, but
I don't know when to use it correctly.

428
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,692
- Not a native speaker.
- I know what's right.

429
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,187
But I'm not gonna say

430
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:23,321
because you're all jerks
who didn't come see my band last night.

431
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:25,247
- You know the correct one?
- I don't know.

432
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:28,952
It's whom when it's the object of the
sentence, and who when it's the subject.

433
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:30,996
- That sounds right.
- It sounds, but is it?

434
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,965
- Ryan use it as an object?
- As an object.

435
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,374
Ryan used me as an object.

436
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:37,085
- Is he right about that?
- How did he use it again?

437
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:39,305
It was Ryan wanted Michael,
the subject,

438
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,558
to explain the computer system,
the object.

439
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,133
- Thank you.
- To whomever,

440
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:47,169
meaning us, the indirect object,
which is the correct use of the word.

441
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:51,373
No one asked you anything ever,
so whomever's name is Toby,

442
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:54,144
why don't you take a letter opener
and stick it into your skull.

443
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:56,895
Hey, this doesn't matter.
And I don't even care.

444
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,928
Michael, you quit the other job
or you're fired here.

445
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:08,144
I've never done this before.
I've never quit anything...

446
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:10,260
in my life,

447
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:12,020
so...

448
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:14,610
You are filming history.

449
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:18,679
Nick, I had a dream last night
that I had two full-time jobs.

450
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:22,123
One here
at the lipaphadrazone diet pill company.

451
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,625
- Lipaphedrine.
- The other,

452
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,129
I was regional manager of a small paper
supply company called Dunder Mifflin.

453
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:30,568
- Never heard of it.
- In this dream,

454
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:33,384
I did both of these jobs beautifully.

455
00:22:33,614 --> 00:22:36,351
And I loved it.
And everybody loved me.

456
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,014
The truth is...

457
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:41,434
- I can't do this.
- Are you quitting?

458
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:44,391
I am.

459
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:48,016
Come back anytime.
Don't forget to disinfect your headset.

460
00:22:49,997 --> 00:22:52,148
I was never in this for the money.

461
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:58,326
But it turns out that the money
was an absolute necessity for me.

462
00:22:58,997 --> 00:23:00,647
I tried to live the dream.

463
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:03,122
I trieto have a job,
a girlfriend,

464
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,918
another job,
and I failed.

465
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:10,797
But the good thing
about the American Dream

466
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:14,156
is that you can just
go to sleep.

467
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:18,397
And try it all again the next night.

468
00:23:25,124 --> 00:23:26,521
So...

469
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:30,377
What's up?

470
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,112
Me, all night, dreaming
about Angela's smoking hot body.

471
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:37,063
- You're being gross.
- Not from a male perspective.

472
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:38,783
You need to set me up with her.

473
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:43,218
I know she told you she's looking and
she's totally not responding my moves.

474
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:44,379
What moves?

475
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:47,250
I've moonwalked past accounting,
like, ten times.

476
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:49,965
- Can't believe it's not working.
- Yeah.

477
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:54,494
I don't know
if I really see you two together.

478
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:58,845
Really? Well maybe you should look
in the small part on your brain.

479
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:00,680
- She's very religious.
- Okay,

480
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:05,217
well I come from a line of W.A.S.P.S.
so long it leads back to Moses.

481
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:07,942
Okay, well she takes
her convictions pretty seriously.

482
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:09,416
She could be kind of severe.

483
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:11,149
Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.

484
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,109
- That's right, you did.
- Yeah.

485
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:17,801
Now that I think about it, Angela and
Andy might actually make a good couple.

486
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:20,842
But I couldn't do that to Dwight...

487
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:22,349
or Angela...

488
00:24:23,903 --> 00:24:24,904
or Andy.

489
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:30,011
Hey Kevin,

490
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,657
you're a gambler, right?

491
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:38,143
A rounder.
You play the ponies, tall horses.

492
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:40,710
I do gamble, Michael.

493
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,914
I was thinking
about doing some gambling myself.

494
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:47,310
You know, just a little bit of money.
Maybe doubling it and then doubling it,

495
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,972
several more times.

496
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,870
I don't know. Kind of just for fun.
I was thinking...

497
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,861
Do you have any tips or ideas
about sure things?

498
00:24:58,181 --> 00:24:59,496
Like a boxer...

499
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:04,827
who is gonna throw the big fight,

500
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:09,207
you know, like he's tied in
to some crooked dealings

501
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:12,418
and maybe his kid is sick or something.
Like, who do I call about that?

502
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:15,607
The mob.

503
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,409
Do you know anybody in the mob?

504
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:23,217
Okay.

505
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:27,486
Oscar...

506
00:25:28,616 --> 00:25:30,603
I'm gonna need
another advance on my salary.

507
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:35,316
- What do you mean you've plans tonight?
- I have my daughter tonight.

508
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:36,981
<i>We're renting Charlotte's Web.</i>

509
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:38,538
Well you have to make a choice.

510
00:25:38,698 --> 00:25:40,780
- It's either your daughter or me.
- My daughter.

511
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:43,513
Okay.

512
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:45,660
I see how it is.

513
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:54,478
That was cold.

514
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:03,112
He's always been terrible with money.

515
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,932
I bet it's Jan
spending him straight to the poorhouse.

516
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:07,911
Yeah, women be shoppin'.

517
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:10,577
I can't believe he has a second job.

518
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:13,277
- He's not even good at his first one.
- Hey guys.

519
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:18,542
Whatcha talking about?

520
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,795
Okay, I know what's going on.

521
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,596
Talking about Jim and Pam.

522
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,109
If they're having sex,
what it looks like... I know.

523
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:32,248
Michael,
are you having money problems?

524
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,932
Monkey problems?
No, I'm not having monkey problems.

525
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:36,711
Why would I have monkey problems?

526
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,213
- I know you heard me correctly.
- Oh, I hate monkeys.

527
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:42,227
What's going on?
Why do you have a second job?

528
00:26:42,671 --> 00:26:44,177
I don't have a second job.

529
00:26:44,525 --> 00:26:47,043
Maybe
I am having an affair

530
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,755
with Suzanne Sommers.

531
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,184
- Jan has no money?
- I don't talk to my girlfriend

532
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:53,636
about money.
It's rude and unsexual.

533
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:56,606
True, it's best to hide
our money problems from women.

534
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,330
I totally agree with you.

535
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,026
But I don't have money problems.

536
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,009
All right, you know what?

537
00:27:03,358 --> 00:27:04,358
Watch this.

538
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:08,267
If I had money problems,

539
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:10,534
would I do this?

540
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,709
- You just put it back in your pocket.
- Yeah.

541
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:24,842
Yeah, but I destroyed it.
It's not even usable anymore.

542
00:27:28,926 --> 00:27:31,474
Hey, let's call this what it is.

543
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:36,842
It's like she only wants to hook up
when Ryan comes around.

544
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:40,225
It's gotten to the point where I get
excited everytime I see that little dude

545
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:41,943
walk through the door.

546
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,154
Well I just need to know
where this is going.

547
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:46,791
Hey,

548
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:48,658
I like you.

549
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:50,966
All right?

550
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:52,656
Why's not to like?

551
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,375
But you need to access
your uncrazy side.

552
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:00,829
Otherwise
maybe this thing has run its course.

553
00:28:03,135 --> 00:28:05,604
Don't you dare walk away from me,
Darryl Philbin.

554
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:07,695
You're the most selfish person
I've ever met...

555
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:08,921
Slow down.

556
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,571
Think it over.

557
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:13,641
Darryl Philbin

558
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:16,514
is the most complicated man
that I've ever met.

559
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:19,447
I mean,
who says exactly what they're thinking.

560
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:23,153
What kind of game is that?

561
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:27,484
Hey, cuz.

562
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,950
- Heard you're having money problems.
- No, you didn't.

563
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,368
Listen, I got the answer.

564
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:35,579
You declare bankruptcy,
all your problems away.

565
00:28:35,893 --> 00:28:37,705
Creed Bratton
has never declared bankruptcy.

566
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:41,580
When Creed Bratton gets in trouble,
he transfers his debt to

567
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,430
William Charles Schneider.

568
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,089
How would that help, Creed?

569
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:47,466
In monopoly,
you go bankrupt, you lose.

570
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,575
You don't go by monoly, man.

571
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:51,027
That game is nuts.

572
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,455
Nobody just picks up
"Get out of jail free" cards.

573
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,496
Those things cost thousands.

574
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:58,328
That is a good point.

575
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:01,272
Bankruptcy, Michael,
is nature's do-over.

576
00:29:01,747 --> 00:29:04,037
It's a fresh start.
It's a clean slate.

577
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,002
Like the witness protection program.

578
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,952
- Exactly.
- Not at all!

579
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,858
I've always wanted to be
in the witness protection program.

580
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:14,297
Fresh start.
No debts, no bagage.

581
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:18,724
I've already got my name picked up:
"Lord Rupert Everton."

582
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,351
I'm a, uh, shipping merchant
who raises fancy dogs.

583
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:25,451
That's the life.

584
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,644
I declare...

585
00:29:34,665 --> 00:29:37,072
bankruptcy!

586
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:51,329
Hey, I just wanted you to know that
you can't just say the word "bankruptcy"

587
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,875
and expect anything to happen.

588
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,160
- I didn't say it, I declared it.
- Still...

589
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:57,287
That's...
That's not anything.

590
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:00,560
This is a lot of credit card debt.

591
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,975
Yeah, tell about it.

592
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,981
You know,
Jan has my credit cards and she's...

593
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:07,339
using 'em as if I'm made of money.

594
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,716
She thinks I'm a human ATM machine.

595
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:12,677
Okay.
$125, Amazon.

596
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,164
<i>Oh, Best of the Muppet Show on DVD.</i>

597
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:17,344
Classic.

598
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,560
$1200.
What's a "Core-Blaster Extreme"?

599
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:24,484
That is by far,
the best way to strengthen your core.

600
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:26,069
This machine...

601
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,984
You sit on a stabilizer ball.

602
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,821
You put your feet
into the power stirrups, you reach up

603
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,480
and you grab onto the super rod.

604
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,325
And you twist
and you twist and you twist.

605
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:37,702
It strengthens your entire core.

606
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:42,639
Your back core,
your arm core, your...

607
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:45,460
The marine corps actually uses it.

608
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:47,712
I think that's how they got "corps."

609
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:55,119
I left a little present for Angela.

610
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:57,594
I think she's going to like it

611
00:30:57,754 --> 00:31:00,883
'cause I found it
outside vance refrigeration all alone.

612
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:04,966
And I told her in the note
that the cat came to find her.

613
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:08,272
That they were
destined to be together.

614
00:31:11,374 --> 00:31:12,487
I got game.

615
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:21,663
Okay, the green bar is what you spend
every month on stuff you need.

616
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:23,810
Like a car or a house.

617
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:27,343
That is so cool
how you have my name at the top.

618
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:32,918
The red bar
is what you spend on non-essentials,

619
00:31:33,078 --> 00:31:35,427
like magazines, entertainments,
things like that.

620
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:40,098
This scary black bar
is what you spend

621
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:43,032
on things that no one
ever, ever needs,

622
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,099
like multiple magic sets,
professional bass fishing equipment.

623
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:49,608
How do you do this so fast?
Is this Powerpoint?

624
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:00,922
Oh, man.

625
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,448
Angela really had a hold on him.

626
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:06,786
Angela.

627
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:09,816
Michael, I'm gonna set you and Jan
up with a debt consolidator.

628
00:32:09,976 --> 00:32:13,048
- You meet with this guy...
- No. We're leaving Jan out of this.

629
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,468
- She has to know.
- We will find another way.

630
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,512
We'll ask Powerpoint.

631
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:20,597
Michael, this is a presentation tool.

632
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:23,763
You're a presentation tool, if you think
I'm gonna tell Jan about this.

633
00:32:23,928 --> 00:32:25,344
- I'm done.
- No, you're not...

634
00:32:25,504 --> 00:32:27,020
Just...
You're not a tool.

635
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,386
Look, I'll tell her that it's bad.

636
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:31,299
But it could've been a lot worse

637
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:36,004
but due to some fancy financial footwork
I was able to cut it in half.

638
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,068
Jan is smart.

639
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,484
She poses.

640
00:32:44,174 --> 00:32:45,622
Dwight, how's the hotel business?

641
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,543
Stupid.

642
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:50,627
You checked Trip Advisor recently?

643
00:32:51,127 --> 00:32:51,928
No...

644
00:32:53,878 --> 00:32:55,143
Maybe you should.

645
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:57,053
Maybe you should...

646
00:32:58,118 --> 00:32:59,158
Whatever.

647
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:04,641
We wrote a good review.
Under comments,

648
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:07,185
we wrote:
"The natural aroma of the beets

649
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:10,581
"drifts into the bedrooms
and makes you dream of simpler times."

650
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:14,150
"The dawn goose walk
will tug at your artstrings."

651
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,898
"Table-making never seemed so possible."

652
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,062
"You will never
want to leave your room."

653
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,244
"The architecture reminds
one of a quaint Tuscan beetfarm."

654
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,542
I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.

655
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:31,996
We really did.

656
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:33,259
It was fun.

657
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:43,716
So due to Michael's
clever financial maneuvering,

658
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:46,376
he finds himself tremendously in debt.

659
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:48,095
<i>You're bro?</i>

660
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:52,901
How did you get that
from what Oscar's saying? That's not...

661
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:56,151
<i>I mean Michael, how did this happen?
Where exactly did your money go?</i>

662
00:33:57,796 --> 00:33:59,312
<i>I...
I don't...</i>

663
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:02,129
<i>I don't get this.
I really don't. I don't...</i>

664
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:04,223
<i>I don't understand how</i>

665
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:06,111
<i>you could be so...</i>

666
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:08,654
<i>irresponsible.</i>

667
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:09,845
<i>I mean...</i>

668
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,002
<i>It is astounding to me, really.</i>

669
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:16,771
<i>- I don't know what more to say...
- Jan?</i>

670
00:34:17,282 --> 00:34:19,159
<i>- Yeah, what?
- Michael left.</i>

671
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,779
<i>- Okay, where did he go?
- I don't know.</i>

672
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:27,047
<i>Well is he coming right back?</i>

673
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:28,799
I don't think so.

674
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:32,787
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

675
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:52,018
What am I doing?
I'm...

676
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:55,925
blowing dodge.
I'm getting out of town.

677
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,949
Whatever you'll call it.
I'm running away from my responsibilies.

678
00:35:02,221 --> 00:35:03,611
And it feels good.

679
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:10,176
You may ask me out to dinner.

680
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:16,076
Nothing fancy or foreign.
No bars, no patios, no vegetables.

681
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:17,530
And no seafood.

682
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:26,442
Dwight.

683
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:52,822
Did I ever tell you
why I left Scranton?

684
00:35:56,143 --> 00:35:57,881
Yeah, I didn't think I had.

685
00:35:58,732 --> 00:35:59,736
Well...

686
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,289
It was all about Pam.

687
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah, I mean...

688
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:09,669
she was with Roy, and...

689
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:12,429
I just couldn't take it.

690
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:16,470
I mean, I lost it, Dwight.

691
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,610
I couldn't sleep,

692
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:22,626
I couldn't concentrate on anything.

693
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:26,794
And then weird stuff, like,

694
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:30,159
food had no taste.

695
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:34,736
So my solution was to move away.

696
00:36:36,598 --> 00:36:37,711
It was awful.

697
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:43,153
And it is something
that I would wish on my worst enemy.

698
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,674
And that includes you.

699
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:26,288
Hey, I was thinking about dinner...

700
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:33,392
Dinner...

701
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:36,146
Let's see, maybe we should try the...

702
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:38,115
new italian place
where was the dry cleaner.

703
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:39,414
- Okay.
- Yeah?

704
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:40,575
Yeah.

705
00:37:40,783 --> 00:37:41,784
Okay.

706
00:37:44,037 --> 00:37:47,025
Jim's just really passionate
about italian food.

707
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,199
Yeah,

708
00:37:50,514 --> 00:37:53,146
I'm very passionate about italian food.

709
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:56,378
In fact...

710
00:37:57,572 --> 00:37:59,460
I'm in love with italian food.

711
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:10,972
- Jan, he went running that way...
- Okay, great. Thanks.

712
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,447
<i>Runaway train never coming back</i>

713
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:22,312
<i>Runaway and I'm never coming back</i>

714
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:23,472
Michael?

715
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:25,785
Hey, Jan.

716
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,473
What's going on?

717
00:38:31,038 --> 00:38:32,038
Not much.

718
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:35,357
- What's up with you?
- Why are you sitting on a train?

719
00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:38,039
- Where are you going?
- I'm out of answers, Jan.

720
00:38:38,408 --> 00:38:39,594
What does that mean?

721
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:41,875
I told you, no more answers.

722
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,815
This is who I am now.

723
00:38:46,912 --> 00:38:49,091
A guy on a train with no answers.

724
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:51,626
I hope that can be enough for you.

725
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:53,197
Michael, come on.

726
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:57,111
Running away from your problems
won't solve anything, you know that.

727
00:38:57,271 --> 00:38:59,322
- I don't know that.
- Creditors can follow you

728
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:02,252
anywhere with ease.
Your debt follows you around the world.

729
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:04,490
- Electronically.
- I'll stay off the grid.

730
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,399
Michael, come on.

731
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:09,653
Come on, you can deal with this.
It's not that bad.

732
00:39:11,212 --> 00:39:12,542
Yeah, it is.

733
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:15,359
It is.

734
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,240
I really messed up.

735
00:39:19,228 --> 00:39:20,229
Well...

736
00:39:22,036 --> 00:39:23,041
When...

737
00:39:24,138 --> 00:39:26,864
When my life fell apart and they...
And they screwed me in New York

738
00:39:27,024 --> 00:39:29,311
and I felt like my whole world
was collapsing around me,

739
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:30,575
I didn't have anyone.

740
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,332
I mean, my whole family still won't even
talk me on the advice of council

741
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:37,652
and my friends...
were just waiting for this to happen.

742
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,321
- That's really nice of you to say.
- Michael, no.

743
00:39:40,648 --> 00:39:44,574
What I want to say is
you were there for me.

744
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:47,052
By my side.

745
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,082
Without even a thought.

746
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:53,322
That's just who you are.

747
00:39:57,884 --> 00:39:58,885
I mean...

748
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:03,562
No matter
how badly I treat you or...

749
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,515
what l'm going through you just...
You are there for me.

750
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,959
And that is a guy
worth staying beside.

751
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:16,471
So where's this train taking us?

752
00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:22,364
I don't...

753
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,697
I think the engineer left.

754
00:40:57,342 --> 00:40:59,708
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute
calling from Dunder Mifflin,

755
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:03,647
and according to our records,
you appear to be low on office supplies.

756
00:41:04,122 --> 00:41:07,074
Okay, sure,
I can take care of that right now.

757
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,309
Don't sell your implants, please.

758
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,082
I'm keeping them.
I know you like them.

759
00:41:17,326 --> 00:41:19,797
- They're kind of uncomfortable though.
- It's nice though.

760
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:23,033
- My nipples aren't as sensitive now.
- Looks cute though.
