1
00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:04,739
Ready?

2
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:07,983
Come on, show me excited!

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,724
- Yes!
-Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.

4
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:15,867
Today I'm heading over to the job fair
at Valley View High School,

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,326
to find some new interns.
Want to get some fresh blood.

6
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:22,319
Euthanize this place.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,948
Hey, are we doing this thing?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:27,457
Oh my God, Darryl,
you look like Barack Obama.

9
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:28,674
Everybody,
I'm dating Barack Obama!

10
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,581
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Like what?

11
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,517
Like you're applying for a loan.

12
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:35,076
Maybe he's going to church.
Or court.

13
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,569
Figured I look presentable.

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,882
You... went a different way.

15
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:40,059
I think you look nice.

16
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:42,290
Here's what we're going to do:

18
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,545
I'm going to instruct the kids
about management and sales.

19
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:47,554
Oscar will be in charge of accounting.

20
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:49,883
Pam will be eye candy.

21
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,465
No... uh, also,
because that is your alma mater.

22
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:56,590
Darryl will hire some kids
for the warehouse.

23
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:58,564
We don't have to worry
about internships with them,

24
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,502
because they definitely
ain't going to college.

25
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:02,614
What college did you go to, Mike?

26
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:03,672
Let's go!

27
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:09,430

31
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:39,553
Today, I am meeting a
potential client on the golf course,

32
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:42,023
because Ryan put me on probation.

33
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:44,400
You remember Ryan,
he was the temp here.

34
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:49,574
Yeah. And it is not a good time
for me to lose my job,

35
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:51,165
since I have some...

36
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,152
pretty big long term plans
in my personal life with Pam,

37
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,888
that I'd like her parents
to be psyched about.

38
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:59,426
So I am about to do something
very bold at this job

39
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,891
that I've never done before:

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,739
Try.

41
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,157
Mister Maguire,
it's been a couple of years.

42
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,925
Jim, how are you?
Nice to see you, man.

43
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:16,435
My grandfather would be
spinning in his urn

44
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:18,706
if he knew that I was out here
with a Dartmouth boy.

45
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:21,895
You take that shirt off right now
or I will take it off for you, sir.

46
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:24,904
I am totally and completely kidding!

47
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:30,290
- Andy Bernard, Cornell, 95.
- McGuire, Darmuth, 74.

48
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,441
- Got some blisties.
- Yeah, you do.

49
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:35,320
Hit about 1,200 balls last night
in preparation for today,

50
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:37,759
so hands are a little tender.

51
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:40,794
It's actually not funny at all.
It's incredibly painful.

52
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,803
Let's make it interesting.
Say, ten bucks a hole?

53
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:44,941
Okay. What are we talking?

54
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:47,984
Skins? Acey Deucy?
Bingo bango bongo?

55
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,401
Sandies, Barkies? Arnies?
Wolf? What?

56
00:02:51,508 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm gonna take this petty cash
that I got from Oscar,

57
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:59,784
and turn it into next month's rent.

58
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:04,986
So many memories in this old gym.

59
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,747
Pretending I have PMS so
I didn't have to play volleyball,

60
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:12,101
pretending I have PMS so
I didn't have to play basketball.

61
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:15,676
Those were the days!

62
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:21,746
A little over the top,
don't you think?

63
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:23,713
Show them
what you brought, Mike.

64
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,261
- That's all we brought.
- This is all we need.

65
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,678
- We'll see.
- Yes we will see, Oscar.

66
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,987
We will see,
because a blank sheet of paper

67
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:36,296
equals endless possibilities.
Conceptual.

68
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:37,343
All right!

69
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:41,090
We are open for business!

70
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:46,538
Hello!

71
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,667
- Andy, you're up, let's go!
- Giddy up, let's do this.

72
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:58,693
People assume I'm great at golf.
But like everybody,

73
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:01,004
I hated golf lessons
when I was a kid. So,

74
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:03,920
I used to hang out
at the sailing club instead.

75
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:05,850
Got my "knot" on.

76
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:09,297
Dammit!

77
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,647
Guys, do we have to stay all day?

78
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:16,964
I mean, Michael's gone,
can't we just go?

79
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:19,290
Yeah, and I finished my work
months ago!

80
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:20,850
Excuse me, people.

81
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,507
It has come to my attention,
some of you have forgotten...

82
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:27,081
who is in charge here.
When Michael is gone...

83
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,011
Jim is in charge.

84
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:31,445
When Jim is gone,
Andy and I are in charge.

85
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,524
When Andy is gone
you answer to me. Okay?

86
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:38,203
Excuse me, where do you think
you're going?

87
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:42,330
You're not leaving.
No! Stanley,

88
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,026
do not walk out that door!

89
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:47,131
If you walk out that door,
so help me, I will...

90
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:50,530
He left.

91
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:52,568
Last time I checked,

92
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,396
the American workday
ends at 5 PM.

93
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:59,975
You will all stay at your desks
until that time.

94
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:02,779
Or you will suffer
the consequences.

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,415
What consequences?

96
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,422
I will tell on you.

97
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,406
There's some filing,
restocking the supply shelves.

98
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,061
Replacing the water jug,
which nobody likes to do.

99
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,548
We...

100
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:19,644
eat a lot of cake!

101
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:24,772
Yeah, and you basically learn
how an office runs.

102
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:27,413
Hello. Hi.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

103
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:29,726
- Excuse me.
- This is Michael, my boss.

104
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:32,264
- Justin.
- Hey, remember what we talked about,

105
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:36,966
in the car on the way up,
"only the best and the brightest"?

106
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:38,734
He's nice and he seems interested.

107
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,572
He's totally wrong, Pam.

108
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:47,324
How you doing? Listen,
I don't think that a handsome,

109
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:50,976
funny, smart, funny-looking
kid like you,

110
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:53,024
should limit himself. You could do
whatever you want to do.

111
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,384
You could be a classy janitor,
or...

112
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,207
a cashier with dignity, or a...

113
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:00,885
migraine worker.

114
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:05,421
Maybe for you,
paper should be more of a hobby.

115
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:07,670
- Sorry for wasting your time.
- Oh, no problem.

116
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,274
And he signed!

117
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:12,060
He put his name on the piece of...

118
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:16,380
That was supposed to be
a blank canvas

119
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:18,654
on which to put
their hopes and dreams.

120
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:22,298
And he just made it
into a stupid piece of paper.

121
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,932
We need another one
immediately.

122
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,175
Yeah, the booth is lame without it.

123
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:29,539
- I only brought the one.
- Are you mental?

124
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:31,816
Michael, do you remember,

125
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,504
you specifically told me
to only bring one sheet of paper?

126
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:37,194
You said it only takes
one sheet to make a difference.

127
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:40,357
And I said, "Are you sure, Michael?"
And you said "Pam! Pam! Pam!"

128
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:41,905
And then you sneezed in my tea,

129
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:44,243
and then you said,
"Don't worry, it's just allergies."

130
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:46,192
- Do you remember that?
- I don't.

131
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,409
Okay. I'll go look for another one.

132
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:56,969
And that is why
I need a smart intern.

133
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:00,943
Hey, so how is
the direct mail business going?

134
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:03,238
I can't complain,
people love their junk mail.

135
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:05,532
Are you getting
all your paper from PPC or...?

136
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:07,142
You know what, Jim?

137
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:09,432
I'm not really looking
to change things up right now,

138
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,467
I just came out here to get out
of the office for a little bit,

139
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:14,701
so why don't we just play, okay?
- Absolutely, will do.

140
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:19,518
So I guess I'll just...
work on my short game.

141
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:27,774
Hello there.

142
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:30,243
What is this company?

143
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:32,448
Well, it's funny that you should ask,
because...

144
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:34,869
it's really more than a company...

145
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:37,272
- Dunder Mifflin paper.
- Thanks.

146
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:40,167
Dammit, Oscar!

147
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,567
Yeah, I'm trying to lure
these kids into my booth,

148
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:47,489
but kids are very wary
about being "lured" these days.

149
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:49,674
Thank you, Dateline!

150
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:54,078
Thank you.

151
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,391
- Extension 128.
- Hiya, Pumpkin, it's Creed.

152
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:11,062
Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch.
You in?

153
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,339
Are you out?

154
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:16,699
Pumpkin's out, let's go, gang!

155
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:39,903
My old art room.

156
00:08:46,974 --> 00:08:48,986
Oh, maybe it's still here!

157
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,982
No, no. They must have
taken it down. Never mind.

158
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:06,576
- What do you want?
- Michael, I know you're swamped.

159
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:10,096
I just thought you should know that
everyone in the office has left,

160
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:12,662
except for Angela and I.
Do not worry though,

161
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:15,914
I have taken down their names,
and I have docked them a personal day.

162
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:19,192
Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not
there, why should they have to be there?

163
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,963
So... what else is up?

164
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,809
Thank you!

165
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:38,683
What, what is this?

166
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:41,844
- A piece of paper.
- This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper.

167
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:44,156
Some sort of Pendleton crap.

168
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,515
Well I think they'll get
the spirit of it.

169
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:51,763
We're dying here.
I want you to go back to the office

170
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:55,564
and I want you to get the real stuff. I
want you to get ultra white card stock.

171
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:58,860
- Are you serious?
- Yes. And don't call me Shirley.

172
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,106
Dammit!

173
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:17,683
You know, you can just pick it up,
take the triple bogey.

174
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,412
Yeah, I'll get it out. Thank you.

175
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:52,017
Come on, Tuna!

176
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:56,294
Hey, can't really talk now,
what's up?

177
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,374
Just checking in, how's it going?

178
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:03,064
You know, we'll see, we'll see.

179
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,959
I just drove 20 miles round-trip
back to the office

180
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:07,806
to get Michael a
single sheet of white paper.

181
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,878
So, I could have just
had them fax it to me, I guess.

182
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:14,722
- I like you.
- Talk to you later?

183
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,315
Yeah. All right. Bye.

184
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:25,035
All right.

185
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:27,533
Sorry, I got to annoy you
one more time.

186
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,012
What if I bring down shipping costs?

187
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:32,140
You can try.

188
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:35,580
But I've looked at your prices.
Even with free shipping?

189
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,189
Doesn't work.
It's just- it's not in the stars, Jim.

190
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,131
Six.

191
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:49,284
All right, race to the next hole!

192
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:52,436
Winner gets ten bucks!

193
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:55,886
- Wait for me! Andy!
- Shortcut! Shortcut!

194
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:05,669
I fell in the sandtrap!

195
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:26,610
All of these jobs suck.

196
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:29,627
I would rather live jobless,
on a beach somewhere,

197
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:32,074
off the money
from a large inheritance...

198
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:34,698
than to have to work in any one
of these crap-holes.

199
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,102
They suck.

200
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,869
Game over.

201
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,975
- Just-in time.
- Hi.

202
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:52,550
Just-in case. What's your last name?

203
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:58,173
- Polznik.
- This just in. Justin Polznik!

204
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:03,031
Justin is the ugly girl in the movie,

205
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,644
who takes off her glasses
and she's hot!

206
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,557
And you realize she was always hot,
she was just wearing glasses.

207
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,659
And that you were the blind one.

208
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:15,054
He's the most
important thing in my life right now.

209
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:18,514
I want you to meet my family.
Come on.

210
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,148
Oscar Martinez. Accountant
extraordinaire. This is Justin.

211
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:26,348
This is Darryl Philbin.
Isn't he big?

212
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:29,499
And you already met her,
Pam Beesly, office hottie.

213
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:31,471
She will do you.

214
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:37,326
No, no. But she has already dated
two guys in the office that we know of,

215
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:40,049
so this could be number three,
you never know.

216
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,064
Come here.

217
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:44,270
I would never
say this to her face,

218
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:46,865
but she is a wonderful person
and a gifted artist.

219
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,951
Why wouldn't you
say that to her face?

220
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,458
What do you think?
Think these guys are nice?

221
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:56,109
The guys I didn't bring are even better.
Justin,

222
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:59,129
I'm willing to commit right now.

223
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:03,439
Would you do me the honor...

224
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,550
of spending the summer
with us, at Dunder Mifflin?

225
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:11,765
- I think you are very special.
- You didn't want me before.

226
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,964
- That's what you said.
- No, I didn't.

227
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:17,239
- You were kind of a jerk to me.
- You misconstrued me.

228
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:20,673
- And I'm, I'm gonna go now.
- Why don't...?

229
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:48,262
Bless you.

230
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,476
Thank you.

231
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:59,799
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty,

232
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,294
and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.

233
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:07,541
Let's open a tab, because you and me
are gonna be playing more often.

234
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,020
- Count me in!
- No.

235
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:10,636
All right!

236
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,205
You had some fun,
and I think I paid for it.

237
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,405
So let me get my last shot in there.

238
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,412
Is there anything
you can do for me?

239
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:23,083
I'll tell you what.
My fiscal year ends in two months.

240
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:26,196
Let's talk then.
Sound good?

241
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:28,426
- Absolutely.
- Good playing with you guys.

242
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:35,686
You know? It's a tough thing,
seeing a grown man take six shots

243
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,980
to get out of a sand trap but, I had
to give Phil credit for not quitting.

244
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,701
Which is what I told him.

245
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:44,120
I also told him I don't quit either,

246
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:47,421
and I'd call him every single day
until he gave me his business.

247
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:52,982
Which he then did, after...
15 minutes of me blocking his car.

248
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,669
So I am now his paper supplier!

249
00:15:57,117 --> 00:16:00,654
And I shot a 102 today,
so I'm feeling pretty good.

250
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:04,717
The job fair will be closing
in five minutes.

251
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:07,846
Eighth period will commence
as scheduled.

252
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,880
Hold down the fort,
I have to do something.

253
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:22,748
Excuse me.

254
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:27,930
If you can hear me, I'd like you to
look around at all these companies

255
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:32,692
and know that none of them
are good enough for you.

256
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:37,697
H and R Block? Come on,
I mean I don't even know what they do.

257
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:43,105
Frank Regan Funeral Home?
Too much formaldehyde!

258
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:44,794
The Air Force?

259
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:49,434
Air Force is cool.
The refreshments?

260
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:53,135
Bush league!
You know, that's not what you want.

261
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:59,779
Okay I see security is coming
so I just want to say,

262
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:03,228
come to Dunder Mifflin.
Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work!

263
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,779
Anybody? Show of hands, anybody
want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?

264
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:10,594
We do not offer college credit,
we cannot give you any sort of pay,

265
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:13,121
but it is a really
fun work environment.

266
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:17,082
Anybody? Show of hands?

267
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:20,806
Damn... it. Okay,

268
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:22,622
I'm gonna wrap it up here.

269
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,302
Thank you for your time,

270
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:28,371
and drive safe.

271
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:52,223
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

272
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:12,656
Beers?

273
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,359
You closed it?

274
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,274
- I closed it.
- Yes!

275
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,425
- Congratulations to you, sir.
- Thank you very much.

276
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:30,431
- Well done.
- Thank you.

277
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:33,256
You know what, screw this!

278
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,131
Today I did something stupid:
I questioned myself.

279
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:44,868
And I will never do that again.

280
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,833
Because I look at somebody
like Jim Halpert

281
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:50,356
and I think, that guy could do
anything he wants to do.

282
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:52,823
He could do anything,

283
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:57,386
and he chooses to work here,
selling paper.

284
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,318
Just like me.

285
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,001
Yeah, kiss her.

286
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,624
Kiss her good.

287
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:15,629
- Hi.
- Hello.

288
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:17,412
I was just wondering...

289
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:20,499
what kind of jobs do you guys have?
- Are you interested in graphic design?

290
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:22,132
Yeah.

291
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:26,227
-  Can I fill out an application?
- Oh absolutely, here, take a seat.

292
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,940
I should let you know right away,
this is just an entry-level job.

293
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:32,771
It's really basic.
We're looking for like, a self starter,

294
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:34,495
someone who can meet deadlines and...

295
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:36,904
pretty much just go
the extra mile, I guess.

296
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:38,423
- I can do that.
- Great. And uh,

297
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,710
obviously we're looking for someone
who knows Photoshop,

298
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,536
and Dreamweaver.

299
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:45,472
Corel Painter, Illustrator,
AfterEffects, all the basics.

300
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,737
I don't know any of those.

301
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:52,680
It's actually not super-complicated.
I'm sure there's some sort of like,

302
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,161
adult education classes in the area.

303
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:57,483
But if you're really serious
about graphic design,

304
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:58,947
one thing about
New York or Philadelphia,

305
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:01,522
they've got amazing programs
out there for design.

306
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:03,177
New York or Philadelphia.

307
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,447
All right. Cool, well, thanks.

308
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:09,414
- And I'll look into those.
- You should.

309
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:11,347
- New York or Philadelphia.
- Absolutely.

310
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:13,260
Thanks.
