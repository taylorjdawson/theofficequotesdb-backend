1
00:00:00,581 --> 00:00:04,433
Christmas time is here!

2
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:06,920
Wow! Thanks, guys.
That sounded amazing.

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:11,975
Hi, I'm * Bernard and I am the
first office Santa ever

4
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:14,677
to make holiday wishes
come true.

5
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:17,148
Who's excited to get their
holiday wishes?

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,655
Holiday wishes...

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,501
What's that, Stanley?

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,271
We know exactly what holiday
you're referring to.

9
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:24,907
It is important to be mindful

10
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,176
of all belief systems
at our holiday party.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,111
I've been here 18 years

12
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:32,682
and I've suffered through some
weird, thematic christmases.

13
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:35,451
A Honolulu Christmas,
a <i>Pulp Fiction</i> Christmas,

14
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:38,521
a Muslim Christmas,
Moroccan Christmas,

15
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:39,872
Mo Rocca Christmas.

16
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:41,457
I don't want it.

17
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,993
Christmas is Christmas
is Christmas is Christmas.

18
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:48,631
I got Stanley tickets to see
Lewis Black for his birthday.

19
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:51,534
Might not have been
the best idea.

20
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:53,185
I don't want no kwanzaa wreath.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,870
I don't need
a dreidel in my face--

22
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:55,972
That's its own thing.

23
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:57,006
And who's that black Santa for?

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,891
I don't care.

25
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:02,678
I know Santa ain't black.
I could care less.

26
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,314
I want Christmas.
Just give me plain

27
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,552
baby Jesus lying in a manger
Christmas.

29
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:20,730
What is the status on my wish?

30
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:21,998
Fulfilled.

31
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:23,165
Brought my bicycle

32
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,034
so I can be
your designated driver later

33
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,669
in the event
that you drink too much,

34
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:28,871
which is by no means required.

35
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,272
What about my wish
that we don't have to attend

36
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,341
meetings that degrade
our sense of adulthood?

37
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:33,709
That, I cannot do.

38
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:36,512
But I did get you
an acre of property on the moon.

39
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:38,781
Where, dark side or light side?

40
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:39,882
Light side.

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,283
Is it by
the sea of tranquility?

42
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:42,985
As a matter of fact, yes.

43
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,186
Directly adjacent.

44
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:46,589
- Beachfront.
- Thank you, Andy.

45
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:48,724
So whose wish is next?

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,725
Oh, what about Santa's wish?

47
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,127
My biggest wish is that

48
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:54,080
you all get along well
with Jessica.

49
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,951
Come on, guys, Jessica.

50
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,569
Jim, tell them who Jessica is.

51
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,937
She's not your grandmother,
is she?

52
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:04,256
Ugh, gam gam's name
is Ruth, Jim.

53
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,875
You should know.

54
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,144
I introduced you on
speaker phone that time.

55
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:10,046
Jessica is
my super serious girlfriend

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,448
who is seriously awesome
and seriously sexy.

57
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:14,350
Only thing that's not serious,
by the way,

58
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,618
our repartee.

59
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,853
That's great.
When you know, you know.

60
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,055
Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?

61
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:21,057
Totally out of your league.

62
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:23,976
So, in summation, ho ho ho,

63
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:25,311
please be nice to Jessica,
and mistletoe

64
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:27,163
is not an excuse
for sexual assault.

65
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:32,101
And don't go near gam gam.

66
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,003
I love Jessica,
and I haven't even met her yet.

67
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,539
It's like, we don't even
need to meet, you know?

68
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,740
I already love you.

69
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:40,276
Stay home.

70
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,777
I just want you to know that

71
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,278
I will be mean to Jessica,
if you want me to be.

72
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,630
Oh, no, no, it's fine, Kelly.

73
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,848
It's really no problem.

74
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,183
I was already planning
on being mean to her.

75
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:48,484
That's okay,
I don't want you to do that.

76
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,586
Hello.

77
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,089
Merry Christmas, Erin.

78
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:56,192
Kelly, happy Pancha Ganapati.

79
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,459
Ew, what is that?

80
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,563
The five day hindu celebration
in December,

81
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,349
honoring the God Ganesh,
patron of the arts.

82
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,817
Cool.

83
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,936
- Hey, man.
- Hey, oh!

84
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,171
How you holding up?

85
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,823
Because of
your wife leaving you.

86
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,974
Kevin.

87
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,276
I actually appreciate
the human intimacy.

88
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:17,246
I feel like a kitten
being cradled by a gorilla.

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,614
Yeah.

90
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:21,650
It's been ten days
since I had sexual intercourse.

91
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,685
Well, you came to
the right place.

92
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,836
Ah.

93
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,039
It-- This party will
cheer you right up.

94
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,257
I hope so.

95
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,792
The corporate party
was wretched.

96
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:33,345
I am so tired of
the Black-Eyed Peas.

97
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,698
It's rock and roll for people
who don't like rock and roll.

98
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:38,501
It's rap for people
who don't like rap.

99
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:41,737
It's pop for people
who don't like pop.

100
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,973
Ah, heartbreaking.

101
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:47,893
Oh, thank you.

102
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:51,397
Well, I hate to have to take
my Santa hat off

103
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:55,151
and put on my hard ass hat,

104
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:58,037
but...This is serious.

105
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,022
It's come to my attention that

106
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,124
somebody who shall
remain nameless

107
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,026
wants to switch desk clumps.

108
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,294
Fine with me.

109
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,862
Jim can leave
any time he wants.

110
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:08,063
- Good-bye.
- Wasn't me.

111
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:09,248
It wasn't either of you.

112
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,200
Kathy wants to leave our clump?

113
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,735
Don't look.

114
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:15,671
Who it was is not important.

115
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:18,240
But she did say that
your constant pranking

116
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,409
and one-upsmanship
is driving her crazy.

117
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,594
She or he.

118
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:23,512
I just want to say
this is not my fault.

119
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:25,915
Okay, the weak
always bully the strong,

120
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,349
contrary to what you see
in the media.

121
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,285
I am always acting
in self-defense.

122
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,022
Occasionally
preemptive self-defense.

123
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:35,057
- Ow, what are you doing?
- Hey! Hey!

124
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,408
Respect the hat.

125
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,194
Pam never seemed to have
a problem with us.

126
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:40,029
All right.

127
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,598
I'm gonna speak in a language
you both understand,

128
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,099
Monet.

129
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,801
- What?
- What is?

130
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:48,370
Money.

131
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:51,207
You both have sizable Christmas
bonuses coming your way.

132
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,841
If I catch either of you
messing with the other,

133
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,877
I will give both bonuses
to the other person.

134
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,580
- Can't do that.
- No, absolutely not.

135
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:59,148
You need consequences.

136
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:01,383
Okay, I want you both
walking on eggshells.

137
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:07,606
Hi, I'm Jessica.
I'm looking for Andy.

138
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,259
Jessica, yes.
We don't say hi.

139
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:13,646
We hug.

140
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:14,763
I'm Erin.

141
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,166
- I-- Oof.
- Sorry.

142
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,167
I hope you feel really welcome.

143
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,485
- We all want you here.
- Oh.

144
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:23,672
My ex is meeting my sex.

145
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:25,341
Which is always scary.

146
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,243
You know?
And not just because

147
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,845
you think they might talk
about your penis.

148
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,280
That's just part of it.

149
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,382
Hey! Jess, Erin.

150
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,583
I hope you're not talking
about my penis.

151
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,802
- Hi.
- Hi.

152
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,188
Hey, everyone,
I want you to meet Jessica.

153
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:42,458
She is an assistant cross
country coach at Bryn Mawr.

154
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:43,659
Wow.

155
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:46,178
Erin, by the way,
amazing receptionist.

156
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,863
Oh, that's great.

157
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,865
Backbone of the office.

158
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,151
Which is funny, actually,
because my spine is a mess.

159
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,168
- What?
- Oh.

160
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:54,153
Scoliosis.

161
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,771
Had to wear a back brace
for three years,

162
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,806
but I never did.

163
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:02,544
Oh, no.

164
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,013
Oh, no, it's kicking in.

165
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:07,166
- Spontaneous...Scoliosis.
- Spontaneous scoliosis.

166
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:11,253
Oh.

167
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,721
This thing could
take your arm off,

168
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:13,839
your head off.

169
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,157
You know,
just exercise caution.

170
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,491
- Thank you.
- All right.

171
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,694
All right.

172
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:20,179
Oh, yeah, and, um...

173
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,964
There's a Christmas party
upstairs tonight

174
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:23,032
I wanted to tell you about.

175
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,833
Isn't that just for popsicles?

176
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,268
Popsicles?

177
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,853
Yeah, like, upstairs people.

178
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,372
'Cause you got
a stick up your butt.

179
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:32,207
See, I thought it was because
they're all so rich

180
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:34,059
they could eat popsicles
all the time.

181
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,444
What?

182
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,112
I-- In my--

183
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,113
Well, you should
definitely come.

184
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,648
The foreman always comes.

185
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,400
Plus it's fun,
you know, cookies,

186
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:43,052
smoked fish,

187
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,570
alcohol, people acting stupid.

188
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,238
You had me at "clookies."

189
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,408
I can't wait to find out
what they are.

190
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,526
What should I wear?

191
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,694
Oh, it's nice.
It's real nice.

192
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:52,895
People get dressed up.

193
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:55,898
I will look so handsome
for you, Darryl.

194
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:07,576
Ah...

195
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,596
I'm gonna s--

196
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,052
Dwight really wants my bonus.

197
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,688
He's trying to entrap me.

198
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:24,426
Oh, God, now I can't drink
at this thing.

199
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,995
I get really pranky
when I drink.

200
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,580
Erin, what can I get for you?

201
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,115
Uh, do you have cola?

202
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,400
Kirkland, if you have it.

203
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:33,585
Why would you come to a bar
and ask for a cola

204
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,087
when you can get some
from the kitchen?

205
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,672
Did some small part of you

206
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,774
want something
a little stronger?

207
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:42,010
Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar,

208
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,779
come and take these shots.

209
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,414
- Oh.
- Yes.

210
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:46,615
Will do.

211
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,617
The fifth one is for you, Erin.

212
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,753
You can take it or leave it.

213
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:52,554
To take it would be to accept

214
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:54,773
that you're at a party
and you're an adult woman

215
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,060
with an adventurous spirit.

216
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,778
To leave it would be fine, too.

217
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,599
- One, two, three.
- Yes.

218
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,317
- Mm.
- Whoa.

219
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:08,070
- Hey, hey, nice.
- Whoo!

220
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:09,638
Jiminy Christmas!

221
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:11,440
Jiminy Christmas, indeed.

222
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:13,575
- Hit 'er up.
- Oh, yes.

223
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,677
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

224
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:22,377
Yeah, I just got my
replacement credit card.

225
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,588
Do you want the number--
Oh, it's 4-7-9-3

226
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:30,593
0-0-3-2-3-3-1-3.

227
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:35,264
The security code is 927.

228
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:37,549
Okay, great,
thank you very much.

229
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,685
Bye.

230
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,641
So Dwight did take the bait.

231
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:46,976
He used my credit card numbers

232
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,146
to send a $200 bouquet
of flowers...

233
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:53,182
To my wife.

234
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:54,183
From me.

235
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:00,689
Boom!

236
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:03,692
Look, it's Christmas,
so you're allowed--

237
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,728
Whoa, hello.

238
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:13,736
♪ ♪

239
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,438
I meant dressed up
compared to normal.

240
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,906
You usually dress
like a ghostbuster.

241
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,058
Okay.

242
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,309
I thought you'd wear a sweater.

243
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:22,111
Since when does a sweater
mean "dressed up"?

244
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,178
Am I your grandson?

245
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:24,413
Come on, stay, all right?

246
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:25,881
It's good for people
to get to know you.

247
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:28,984
As a contestant on
<i>dancing with the stars,</i> maybe.

248
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,354
I want my sugar-free cookie,

249
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:35,157
and then I want a sugar cookie.

250
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,425
And then I want my nap.

251
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,427
That's right.

252
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,062
Thank you.

253
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,897
She is remarkable.

254
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,500
- Edgy impressions.
- Thank you.

255
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:46,268
How many drinks
have you had tonight?

256
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,003
I can't be driving
everybody home.

257
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:50,673
- A thousand.
- Whoa!

258
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,925
Maybe you should take a break.

259
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,445
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

260
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,431
Just kidding.

261
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:03,352
Ah, I've been attacked!

262
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,636
Oh, my God.

263
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,755
Oh, someone put a porcupine
in my drawer.

264
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,590
Oh, my God.

265
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,092
Yeah, I was just
sitting here at my desk,

266
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,276
and I reached into my drawer

267
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,929
to grab my toothbrush
and some tooth powder,

268
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,397
and-- and all of a sudden,

269
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:18,467
I was attacked by this
bloodthirsty rabid creature.

270
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:22,171
I wonder, in this office,
who has access to a porcupine?

271
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,641
Or who in this office
knows that I have access

272
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:27,609
and is trying to set me up?

273
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,161
Hm, you know, this sounds a lot

274
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,881
like the premise of
my latest Chad Flenderman novel,

275
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,216
<i>a murder for framing.</i>

276
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,517
Chad Flenderman.

277
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,853
Just an easy-going black guy
who knows the streets,

278
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,522
yet he also went to Oxford.

279
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,959
So just as comfortable
on a motorcycle

280
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:47,296
as he is on <i>Air Force One.</i>

281
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,733
Oh, and he's also the world's
leading egyptologist.

282
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:55,104
Toby, nobody cares about
your sex-crazed black detective.

283
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,056
No, no, no, no, no,
women chase him.

284
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:58,357
H-he misses his wife.

285
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,342
Hello,
lacerated hand here, folks.

286
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:02,044
Nice try.
This is ridiculous.

287
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,345
Oh, is it really?

288
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,581
Two separate times
you have set me up to believe

289
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:07,549
that I was being recruited
by the CIA.

290
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,351
- Three times, actually.
- You see?

291
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,186
Jim, this has
your fingerprints all over it.

292
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,204
Andy, you've got to be
kidding me.

293
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,623
Fingerprints can be planted.

294
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:15,791
You know,
with a severed hand--

295
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:16,825
Do you think that's
what happened?

296
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,210
Do you think he used
a severed hand?

297
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,211
Okay, you know what,
why don't we just

298
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,362
call Animal Control?

299
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,064
You might want to run that
by Angela.

300
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,766
'Cause it's so cute.

301
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,034
No. Porcupines
don't have souls.

302
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:27,302
They're like dogs.

303
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:28,504
Yes, I'm calling
from Dunder Mifflin.

304
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:30,639
We have a very rabid porcupine
in our office.

305
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:32,107
Someone should come pick it up.

306
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:33,509
Come down right away.

307
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,544
Uh, I don't know, let me ask.
Uh, were you quilled?

308
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:36,678
Yes, I was quilled.

309
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:38,080
- And what's its name?
- Henrietta.

310
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,550
- Oops.
- What?

311
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,487
All right.
Get her out of here, Dwight.

312
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:52,528
♪ ♪

313
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:59,501
Guys, I just wanted to say--
Come here.

314
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,253
I am so happy
you guys are together.

315
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,437
Okay?

316
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,257
And you both have
such beautiful hair.

317
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,258
Thank you.

318
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,628
I hope you guys get married.

319
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,679
And who knows?

320
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,264
Maybe at the wedding
I meet someone.

321
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,632
Okay.

322
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:16,752
And later on tonight,
I hope I see you guys kiss.

323
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,491
Yay.

324
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,493
Okay, well, I'm gonna go do
another reverse spit.

325
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:28,530
That's how the cool kids
say "get a drink."

326
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,603
That's, uh, that's the girl
you dated.

327
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:37,489
Um, yeah,
she's not really like that.

328
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,958
It's...

329
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,710
No, she-- she seems fun.

330
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:45,848
- Yeah, uh, excuse me.
- Okay.

331
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:47,182
- Hey.
- Hey.

332
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:50,485
Have you had anything to eat
besides candy canes?

333
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,955
- Every Martini has an olive.
- Okay.

334
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,390
Maybe I should make you some
oatmeal or something.

335
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:57,059
I don't want to put you out,

336
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,627
but if someone's
making oatmeal,

337
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:59,928
I'll take an apple cinnamon

338
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:02,898
and a maple brown sugar
in one bowl with whole milk.

339
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:04,966
Hey, I never told you
my Christmas wish.

340
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,802
- Okay.
- It's about you.

341
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:09,271
That's not what it should be.

342
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,073
It should just be like
a trinket or something.

343
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:14,543
I'd said I wish
Jessica was dead.

344
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:18,330
You-- you mean you wish
she wasn't here or something.

345
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,999
I wish she was in a graveyard

346
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,817
under the ground

347
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:26,488
with worms
coming out of her mouth.

348
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,840
Hey, you know,
you can't say that, okay?

349
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,326
That's my girlfriend
that you're talking about.

350
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,263
You and I
are not together anymore.

351
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:35,931
You need to get over it.

352
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,200
Take your wish back.

353
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,002
Too late.
It's already been wished.

354
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,638
And you promised
it would come true.

355
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:44,439
You wrote it in an email!

356
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:49,111
So which one are you,
