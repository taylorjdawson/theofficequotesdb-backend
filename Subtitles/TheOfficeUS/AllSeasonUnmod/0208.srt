1
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,113
You should get
one of these.

2
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,614
No, thank you.

3
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,942
Do you even know
what this is?

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,750
It is a fitness orb and it
has completely changed my life.

5
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,958
Forget everything you thought
you knew about ab workouts.

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,017
Done.

7
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:33,225
This ab workout is specifically
designed to strengthen your core.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,895
Sorry.
It's all right.

9
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,636
Numerous health benefits,

10
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,964
strengthens your back,

11
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,102
better performance in sports,

12
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,542
more enjoyable sex.

13
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,614
You're not having sex.

14
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,753
Plus, improves
your reflexes.

15
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:56,816
See, I would have
caught that.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,450
Okay, you know what,
how much is that?

17
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,925
It's only 25 bucks.

18
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,086
Wow.

19
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,255
Okay.

20
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,639
Pam, can I see you
in my office?

21
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,710
It's performance
review day, company-wide.

22
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,880
Last year, my performance
review started

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,442
with Michael asking me
what my hopes and dreams were

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,889
and it ended with him telling me
he could bench press 190 pounds.

25
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,191
So, I don't really know
what to expect.

26
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,329
Pam, you're trustworthy.
Thank you.

27
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,693
And a woman.
Oh, no.

28
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,393
And I want you to listen
to a voicemail from my boss.

29
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,432
Michael, it's Jan.
I guess I missed you.

30
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,942
I'll be there this afternoon
for performance reviews.

31
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,806
I hope it's understood that that
will be our only topic of discussion.

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,006
See you soon.

33
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,776
First impressions?

34
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,246
Just off the top,

35
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,981
I think she'll be here
this afternoon.

36
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,488
My boss is
coming in today.

37
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,252
The lovely Jan Levinson-Gould.

38
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,089
Well, no Gould,
the Gould has been...

39
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,423
Divorce.

40
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:49,230
The awkward part is that this is the first
time we'll be seeing each other since...

41
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,631
Well...

42
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,703
It was
really nothing.

43
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,435
We just sort of
got caught up in the moment.

44
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,443
The vulnerable divorcee

45
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:03,472
gives herself to the "understanding
with rugged good looks" office manager.

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,577
Just, she didn't want it
to continue for some reason.

47
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,618
We both didn't.
I didn't want it.

48
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,421
We both didn't want it to
continue. It was not professional.

49
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,828
When people say something's
mutual, it never is.

50
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,729
But this was mutual.

51
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,562
I guess I missed you.

52
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,866
"I guess I missed you. "

53
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,234
So she misses me?

54
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,099
She missed you.

55
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,977
But then she goes on to say, "That
will be our only topic of discussion. "

56
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,415
That doesn't mean anything.
Those are just words.

57
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,883
I have one idea
of what it means.

58
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,284
Okay, yeah. What? What?

59
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,652
Well, I don't think you're
gonna be very happy with this.

60
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,350
Oh, great.

61
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,261
All right, well,
now I'm in a terrible mood.

62
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,929
Let's do your
performance review.

63
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,989
Because she's conflicted.

64
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,227
She has to be professional, but
she's fighting feelings for you.

65
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,406
Why... That's great news.
That...

66
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,868
Why would I not like that?

67
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,903
Just 'cause that you work
together and it might be awkward.

68
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,381
Wow, wow.

69
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,875
All right, let's listen
to that again.

70
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,719
Michael, it's Jan.
I guess I missed you.

71
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,988
Oh, hey.

72
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,124
Listen, Jim,

73
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,394
here's a little tip
for your performance review.

74
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,589
Okay.
Tell Michael that

75
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:28,756
we should be stocking more of the
double-tabbed manila file folders.

76
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,359
We don't have double-tabbed
manila file folders.

77
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,494
Oh, yes, we do.
No, we don't.

78
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,096
Yeah, it's a new product. So, you
should just suggest that to him

79
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,004
and then he'll be sure
to give you a raise.

80
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,406
All right.

81
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,609
Well, I'm not asking
for a raise.

82
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,614
I'm gonna actually be asking
for a pay decrease.

83
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,118
That is so stupid.
What if he gives it to you?

84
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,479
Then I win.

85
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,751
You know what? I am going to zone
you out for the rest of today.

86
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,621
Okay. I need to stay focused.

87
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,786
And I don't have to
see you tomorrow or Sunday,

88
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,628
and please don't call me, and
we'll see how things go Monday.

89
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,128
Stupid.

90
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,768
Wait, wait, one thing.

91
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,400
By tomorrow,
you mean Saturday, right?

92
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,474
Duh!
Duh.

93
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:14,279
Today is Thursday, but Dwight
thinks that it's Friday.

94
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,012
And that's what I'll be
working on this afternoon.

95
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,843
Sometimes women say more in their
pauses than they say in their words.

96
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,786
Really?
Oh, yes.

97
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:28,293
Let's listen to it again, and this
time, really listen to the pauses.

98
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,521
God, Stanley. That's freaking
brilliant. How do you know that?

99
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,497
Did you learn that
on the streets?

100
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:37,366
I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. I
did learn it on the streets.

101
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,337
On the ghetto, in fact.

102
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,138
No kidding.

103
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,809
It's all about
my bonus.

104
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,437
Michael and Jan
definitely made out.

105
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,413
Oh!
Maybe more.

106
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,310
Oh, also it is Thursday,
but Dwight thinks it's Friday.

107
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,876
So, keep that going.

108
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,285
Oh, yay!

109
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,128
Good work, Stanley.
Great performance review!

110
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,857
Stanley in the house,
everybody!

111
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,760
Angela, your turn.

112
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,394
I actually look forward
to performance reviews.

113
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,804
I did the youth beauty pageant
circuit and I enjoyed that quite a bit.

114
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,536
I really enjoy being judged.

115
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,375
I believe I hold up very well
to even severe scrutiny.

116
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,745
Michael?
Yeah?

117
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,283
Jan's on the phone for you.

118
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,515
Angela, you were totally
satisfactory this year.

119
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,653
Interesting. Jan is calling me.
Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all.

120
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,420
Yeah?

121
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,961
Michael...
Jan!

122
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,191
Hello. To what do I owe this pleasure?

123
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,060
I'm returning your many calls.
Well, hello to you, too.

124
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,571
Yeah, I was just...

125
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,965
I just wanted to
get some closure

126
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,568
on what transpired
between us at the meeting

127
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,443
we had in the parking lot
of the Chili's.

128
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,676
No.

129
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,115
No, we won't be
discussing that, Michael.

130
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,951
The only things I wanna talk about
during your performance review

131
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,083
are your concrete ideas
to improve your branch.

132
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,460
Well, surely,
this review is a formality

133
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:16,366
because of what happened at our meeting
in the parking lot of the Chili's.

134
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,496
The review is anything
but a formality, Michael.

135
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,870
And I expect you
to forget anything

136
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,774
that you think may have
happened between us

137
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,745
and exhibit completely
professional behavior.

138
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:28,906
Been thinking about you.

139
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,849
Okay, that is an example of
completely unprofessional behavior.

140
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,183
I don't see how
that's unprofessional.

141
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,516
Michael?
Yeah?

142
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,853
Are the cameras in there
with you, in your office?

143
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,586
No. They are not.

144
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,429
Yes, they are.

145
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,698
That's my girlfriend.

146
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,535
I heard they made out
and had sex.

147
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,005
I heard they just
made out. That's it.

148
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:01,172
Well, I heard they made out
and had sex.

149
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,078
Don't talk about it.

150
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,685
Office romances are nobody's
business but the people involved.

151
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,687
Romances?

152
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,326
Pam, I have ideas
on a daily basis, I know I do.

153
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,962
I have a clear memory
of telling people my ideas.

154
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,868
Is there any chance that you wrote
any of my ideas down in a folder,

155
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,302
like an idea folder?

156
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,361
Sorry.

157
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,464
That's unfortunate.

158
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,439
How about the suggestion box?
There's tons of ideas in there.

159
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,571
What suggestion box?

160
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,672
The suggestion box
that I put out.

161
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,309
And people could put in
suggestions anonymously.

162
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,818
Maybe there's prizes.

163
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,288
Oh, yeah, I think I remember that
from back when I first started.

164
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,326
Why don't you find it and then
tell people to get their...

165
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,587
No, never mind.
I'll tell them.

166
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,789
Hello? Everybody?
Yeah, attention, please.

167
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,059
Jan Levinson's
coming very soon

168
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,035
and so we're gonna have our
weekly suggestion box meeting.

169
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,835
So you can all get in your
constructive compliments ASAP.

170
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,700
Don't you mean
constructive criticism?

171
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,800
What did I say?

172
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,243
You said constructive compliments.
That doesn't make any sense.

173
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,804
Well, Kelly, that was neither
constructive nor a compliment,

174
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,783
so maybe you should
stop criticizing my English

175
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,821
and start making some
suggestions, okay?

176
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,352
Hey, Dan, this is Jim.
It is about 11:15

177
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,655
and I wanted to know
what you were up to tomorrow,

178
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,527
which is the 15th,
and that is a...

179
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,293
Saturday.
Saturday.

180
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,095
So just let me know
what you're doing tomorrow,

181
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,499
Saturday, for lunch.

182
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,470
Okay, talk to you soon.

183
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,738
Address this
when we meet again.

184
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,535
Okay. Okay, bye-bye.

185
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,979
Would you please tell
Michael that I'm here?

186
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,107
Sure.

187
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,743
Hi, Jan. How are you? Hi,
Michael. I'm good. How are you?

188
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:47,808
Good to see you.

189
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,787
Nice to see you.
Okay.

190
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,951
Okay, why don't we just
step into my office?

191
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,793
We're gonna go in here. Could
we please go into your office?

192
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,795
Yeah, right after you.

193
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:58,886
Apres vous.

194
00:09:58,965 --> 00:09:59,954
No calls.

195
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,368
I'll get that.
Oh, thank you.

196
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,911
It's nice to see you. Nice
to see you, too, Michael.

197
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,504
Really?
Not like that.

198
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,570
Oh, well...

199
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,678
You know, Michael, I think I need to
make something clear right off the top.

200
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,553
I'm not going to discuss anything with
you other than Dunder Mifflin business.

201
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,251
All right.
Period.

202
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,623
Do we understand each other? Absolutely.

203
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,356
I'm a little confused because
first it's, like, all kissy-kissy

204
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,524
and then it's, like, all regret
because, "Oh, I regret that.

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,330
"But, wait, I'm still
gonna call you.

206
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,065
"But we're just
gonna talk business,

207
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,165
"and I may come down there and
fire you if you don't do your job. "

208
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,370
But what were we talking about
when we first kissed?

209
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,469
Business.

210
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,174
So, are you still in the middle
of the performance reviews then?

211
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,946
No, no, no. I finished all that.
I'm very fast. I'm not too fast.

212
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,648
Not like, "Wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am. "

213
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,121
But I do say,
"Thank you, ma'am. "

214
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,852
But I'm not like,
"Wham bam. "

215
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,392
Not that there's anything wrong
with "wham bam," if it's consensual.

216
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,099
We're talking
about office stuff.

217
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,297
Can I ask you a question?
No.

218
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:17,103
This is a business question.
It's nothing personal, I promise.

219
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,336
Fine.

220
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,479
Are you wearing
a new perfume today?

221
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,212
How is that
a business question?

222
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,150
Well, you're wearing it
at the office, and...

223
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,914
It... I'm sorry, no offense,
but it's really sexy.

224
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,480
Please don't
smell me, Michael.

225
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,964
Hey, Jim.
Hey. How's it going?

226
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,965
Oh, my God, did you see
The Apprentice last night?

227
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,968
Of course. It's on every Thursday
night, so how could I miss it?

228
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,231
Can you believe who Trump
fired? No, that was unbelievable.

229
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,136
Who? Who was it?
Who did he fire?

230
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,970
You didn't see it?
No.

231
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,341
I went out and got drunk with my
laser tag team last night. Crap!

232
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,672
Never go out on a Thursday night.
What the hell was I thinking?

233
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,745
I don't understand...

234
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,285
Hold on. Sorry.

235
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,848
Yes, Pam.

236
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,323
Michael, it's time for
the suggestion box meeting.

237
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,384
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I wish you wouldn't interrupt.

238
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,520
You told me to buzz you

239
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,689
about the suggestion box
meeting when Jan was here.

240
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,029
I did not, not,
not use those words.

241
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,797
I'd like to sit in on that
meeting. Is it happening right now?

242
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,962
No, it's in, like,
10 minutes.

243
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,165
Everyone's waiting
in the conference room.

244
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,901
Great. Very good.

245
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,182
Why are we here?
Because I value your opinions.

246
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,947
Now, I know a lot of you don't think
that I read your suggestions, but I do.

247
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,353
I just sift through them
every week

248
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,918
and I really look and scrutinize
to see what you guys are writing.

249
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:47,163
So, let's just read
some of these suckers, okay?

250
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,030
All right. Number one.

251
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:53,363
"What should we do
to prepare for Y2K?"

252
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,770
I thought you read these
every week?

253
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,240
Well, obviously, this
one got stuck in the box.

254
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,174
That happens occasionally.

255
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,805
It happens occasionally. And, so...

256
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,512
One down! Next suggestion.

257
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:09,484
"We need better outreach for
employees fighting depression. "

258
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,217
Okay. All right,
enough with the jokes.

259
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,316
Nobody in here is suffering
from depression.

260
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,293
That sounds serious,
Michael.

261
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,694
Oh, okay. Well, yeah?
Who wrote it?

262
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:19,924
Tom?
Tom.

263
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,433
Then, it is a joke because
there's nobody in here named Tom.

264
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,993
Tom? He worked in accounting
up until about a year ago.

265
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,032
Tom.

266
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,077
Oh, that guy?
That guy was weird.

267
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,876
All right, next suggestion.
Next suggestion.

268
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:43,314
"You need to do
something about your B.O."

269
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,086
Okay. Now, I don't know who
this suggestion is meant for,

270
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,423
but it's more of
a personal suggestion.

271
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,224
And it's not an
office suggestion.

272
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,027
Far be it from me to use this as
a platform to embarrass anybody.

273
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,364
Aren't the suggestions
meant for you?

274
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,567
Well, Toby, if by me

275
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,836
you are inferring
that I have B.O.,

276
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,772
then I would say that that is
a very poor choice of words.

277
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,514
Michael, he wasn't inferring, he
was implying. You were inferring.

278
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,051
Was I, Creed?

279
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,519
Okay, well, you know
what I am implying

280
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,923
is that when we're on an elevator
together, I should maybe take the stairs.

281
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,984
Because talk about stank.

282
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,559
Not that I would ever say
something like that in public,

283
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,394
and I never have,
and I never will.

284
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:31,459
I just think it's something that
we should all be aware of, okay?

285
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,739
Now that we've learned this,
let's continue.

286
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,831
See, this is good.

287
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,775
We're learning and we're
figuring some stuff out.

288
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,278
"You need to do something about
your coffee breath. " Okay, no!

289
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,815
"You need to do something... " Shut
up, shut up, shut up, Dwight. Okay.

290
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,343
I don't think you people are grasping
the concept of the suggestion box.

291
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,355
Sometimes you talk to
us real close. Yeah?

292
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,158
Is that hard for you?
All right. Well...

293
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,318
Well, when you have
coffee breath it's hard...

294
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,383
I'll work on that.

295
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,759
Okay, let's keep going.

296
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,024
Just keep it going.

297
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:05,126
Yup. What do we have here? We
have somebody's piece of gum.

298
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,438
Somebody put a piece of gum in
there. This is not a garbage can.

299
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:13,467
This is the future of our company.
This is not a place for gum, okay?

300
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,013
I don't want to have
to read these tomorrow.

301
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,379
Yeah. Who wants to
come in on a Saturday?

302
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,510
Yeah... What?
All right. Next suggestion.

303
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,248
"Next suggestion. "

304
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,715
"Don't... " Okay, that's blank.
Don't... Just...

305
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,523
Put it...
"Don't sleep with your boss. "

306
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,861
Do you think this is
referring to you boning Jan?

307
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,131
I can't... I don't understand
why you're so upset.

308
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,226
I can't... All right,
please sit down.

309
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,862
I'm going to sit over here,
you're gonna sit over there.

310
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,099
Why are you...
Let me ask you this.

311
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,073
Please sit yourself down.
Let me ask you something.

312
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,576
What, Michael? Where
did you get your outfit?

313
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,711
You're gonna give me this
raise. I deserve this raise.

314
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,548
Yes! Yes! Yes!

315
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,125
The least you can do is keep my
salary consistent with inflation.

316
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,560
Yes! Why are you gonna
give me this raise?

317
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,758
Why?

318
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,030
Because I'm awesome!

319
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,197
I am awesome!

320
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:19,341
I just don't understand why you have
to pretend like nothing happened.

321
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,641
Because nothing did, Michael.

322
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:26,684
I'm not gonna say anything more about it
and I would advise that you do the same.

323
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,117
Look...
Michael.

324
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,519
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I'm interrupting. Oh, God.

325
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,387
Were you guys making out?
No, Dwight. Come in.

326
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,949
Great.
What do you want, Dwight?

327
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,120
I am ready for my
performance review.

328
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,356
Okay, great.

329
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,196
Your performance has been
adequate. You may leave. Goodbye.

330
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,563
Is this how you've been conducting
all the reviews, Michael?

331
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,833
Do you want to talk now? Good.
Okay, Dwight, leave.

332
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,137
Wait, I would like to
discuss my raise.

333
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,701
Why on earth would
we give you a raise?

334
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,078
That is an excellent question.
Thank you for asking it.

335
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,151
Let me bring up one word.
Dedication.

336
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,082
I have never been late.

337
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:10,488
Also, I have never
missed a day due to illness,

338
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,996
even when I had
walking pneumonia.

339
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,465
I even come in on holidays.

340
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,525
You do? How do you get in?

341
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,230
I have a copy of your key.

342
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,898
That's a serious offense.
That is a serious offense.

343
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,464
Very serious.

344
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,634
As is toying
with a man's heart.

345
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,303
Oh, Michael, for God's sakes.

346
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,371
I'd also further like to talk
about my merits in the workplace.

347
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,076
Okay, third wheel, why don't
you do that? For instance,

348
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,211
the time I brought in deer
jerky for the whole office.

349
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,450
That was deer? Gross.
Oh, God! You liked it.

350
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,389
Did not.
Jan, have you ever had deer?

351
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,926
No.
It's a delicacy.

352
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,757
And, you know what?
It's an aphrodisiac.

353
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,955
So when we're done here,

354
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,622
you guys could go over
to the Antler Lodge,

355
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,495
sample some deer,
and talk about my raise.

356
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,829
What do you say, Jan?

357
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,460
Okay, here's what
I'm gonna do.

358
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,368
I'm gonna step outside,
collect my thoughts,

359
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,963
and I will return
in about 10 minutes.

360
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,407
Okay, you just clear your
head. Thank you, Dwight.

361
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,670
Look, I know it's your job,
I know you have to ask,

362
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,409
but I promise you I'm not
gonna discuss it with him,

363
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,883
I'm certainly not gonna
discuss it with you.

364
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,613
Do you have a light?

365
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,485
And in conclusion, I think Lex
Luther said it best when he said,

366
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,220
"Dad, you have no idea

367
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,594
"what I'm capable of. "

368
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,756
That's from Superman?
Smallville.

369
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:24,701
And that is why I feel
I deserve this raise.

370
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,132
Do you think Michael
and Jan actually...

371
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,841
I don't really wanna picture
it. But thank you, Pam.

372
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,710
How do you
come back from that?

373
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,211
You don't,

374
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,411
I don't think, come
all the way back, you know.

375
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,045
Especially working together.

376
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,147
No, I mean doing that
with Michael.

377
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,057
How do you come back from that
as a human being?

378
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,459
Yeah. No,
I don't think you can.

379
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,723
I'm heading back to New York.

380
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,392
Alan and I will conduct
your performance review

381
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,559
over the phone tomorrow.

382
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,102
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Okay? Good.

383
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,139
No, no, no, come...
I just want to know why.

384
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,333
Michael, now is
not the time or the place.

385
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,273
Okay, so you're saying that
there is a different time or place

386
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,368
that we could have
this discussion?

387
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,913
No. I am saying we are never
gonna have this conversation.

388
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,109
Well, okay. What? Never?
As in never, ever, ever?

389
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,482
Or never as in
there's still a chance?

390
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,714
Never for me always means
never, ever, ever.

391
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,918
I just want to know, from the
horse's mouth, what is the dealio?

392
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,358
You know, Michael...
Am I too short?

393
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,156
Michael, it has nothing to do
with your looks, okay?

394
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:27,995
It's your personality. I mean,
you're obnoxious, and rude,

395
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,227
and stupid, and you do have
coffee breath, by the way.

396
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,103
And I don't agree
about the B.O.,

397
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,167
but you are very,
very inconsiderate.

398
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,105
Really?
Really. You're...

399
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,973
You're a great guy, okay?

400
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,744
I appreciate that,
thank you.

401
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,216
And you were very sweet.

402
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,187
And you stayed up with me
and talked to me

403
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,453
and cried with me,
and I appreciate that.

404
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,151
No, I didn't. I was...
I don't cry.

405
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,718
But I just am not in a place right now
where I'm looking for a relationship.

406
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,994
So, we can still work together,
we can still be friends, but...

407
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,495
Okay?

408
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,368
So my looks have
nothing to do with it?

409
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,231
Oh, God.

410
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:19,350
Jan is not in a place where she feels
she can have a relationship right now,

411
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,353
and it doesn't matter
how great a guy I am.

412
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,718
And that is all I needed.

413
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,418
I'm good. I can go home now.

414
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,130
Hey, it's 12:20.
Where the hell's Dwight?

415
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,532
No idea.

416
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,736
"Never missed a day," my ass.

417
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,221
I'm here! I'm here!

418
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,220
I'm here. It's okay!
