1
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:10,635
I have a reservation in your fair city

2
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:13,138
From February 12th through the 19th,

3
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:15,307
First week of the olympics.

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,908
Well, we're looking forward to having you,

5
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,211
So let me just pull up
your information here.

6
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:21,013
- Okeydoke.
- I don't seem to have it, sir.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,314
What?

8
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:24,383
I'm not seeing anything
under confirmation.

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,817
- No--
- could it be under affirmation?

10
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:27,152
You have thousands of those. - No.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,854
We're just trying to look it up right now.

12
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:30,956
i>- You did get the evite
to my barbecue!</i>

13
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,290
- N--come on, dwight.
- Michael--

14
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:34,593
Um, sir, a lot of people are trying to get

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,962
Last-minute reservations at
hotels here for the olympics,

16
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,930
But we've been fully booked for months.

17
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,932
Well, I have been booked for three years.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,701
So you should have that.

19
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:44,169
I have always heard that british columbia

20
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:45,704
Is a very nice place,

21
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:48,140
But I'm not getting that
from this conversation.

22
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:50,175
Wait! I got it! Confirmation code--

23
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:52,978
Xv2rdm!

24
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:54,346
[softly] oh.

25
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:55,347
Here it is.

26
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:56,948
- Oh...
- Yep. Uh-huh.

27
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,150
- Uh, thank you.
- Seven nights

28
00:00:58,217 --> 00:00:59,484
In our street view economy single.

29
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:00,919
- That's it.
- Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:02,521
Yeah. We changed systems a while back.

31
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:03,955
I do apologize.

32
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,524
<i>Together: Uh-huh. Okay...</i>

33
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:07,025
How may I help you, mr. Scott?

34
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:10,028
All right, I would like to
cancel my reservation, please.

35
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:12,164
Well, there is a
cancellation fee for this, sir.

36
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,499
Okay. Put it on my card.

37
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:17,169
[cheerful music]

39
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:37,222
Today jo bennett, the ceo from sabre,

40
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,659
Is coming to see us here for the first time.

41
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,162
She bought us sight unseen,
like a mail order bride.

42
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,964
[chuckling] so she's gotta be kinda nervous.

43
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:48,300
I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart?

44
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,635
Are we cool? Are we too cool?

45
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:52,871
Do we speak english?

46
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:56,408
[woman chuckling]

47
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:57,409
Ha ha.

48
00:01:57,477 --> 00:01:59,044
Why, hello!

49
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:01,213
- This is michael scott, co-regional manager

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,247
Of this branch.

51
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:04,116
Pleasure to meet you, miss bennett.

52
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:05,684
Uh, that's mrs. Bennett, sweetheart.

53
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,586
My husband and I are divorced,
but I kept the mrs.

54
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:09,187
Just to piss off the new wife.

55
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,655
Oh... All: [chuckling]

56
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:12,524
Well, let's take a
gander around this place.

57
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,259
These sure are pretty dogs.

58
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:17,062
- They love a good crotch.
- Yeah, they sure do.

59
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,763
You should take that as a compliment.

60
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:21,333
Oh, I do.

61
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,603
- Hello?
- Hello.

62
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,905
Do you always stay seated
when a lady enters the room?

63
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:28,273
I am treating you the same as a man

64
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:30,609
For whom I would also not stand.

65
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:33,812
Unless it was the president. Or judge judy.

66
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,081
I like that.

67
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:37,582
- Um, this is accounting.
- Uh-huh.

68
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,683
Hi.

69
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:39,918
- Good
-looking group.

70
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:42,587
Over here is meredith palmer,
creed bratton.

71
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:44,222
Another couple of heartbreakers.

72
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,091
Who's this tall drink of sun tea?

73
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,292
That is jim halpert.

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,494
He is the co-regional
manager of this office.

75
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:50,829
I thought this guy was the manager.

76
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:52,297
Oh, he is. He's the comanager.

77
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:56,601
That's the other comanager.
Two guys doing one job?

78
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,236
We gotta do something about that.

79
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,106
[chuckles]

80
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:04,142
Got some valentines cards for my coworkers

81
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,311
And my bro-workers.

82
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,445
No. No--

83
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:08,914
What--no candy?

84
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,749
Valentine's day, right around the corner.

85
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,251
Erin and I have been on zero dates.

86
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,287
So I got her a valentine's day card.

87
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:17,789
But I didn't want to seem too eager,

88
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:20,458
So I got cards for everyone
in the whole office

89
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:21,826
To kind of dilute it a little bit.

90
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:22,827
Look alive.

91
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:24,062
Ow!

92
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,298
Jeez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!

93
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:28,133
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting

94
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:30,569
Or threatening to cut my throat.

95
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,270
Don't try to cut my throat.

96
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,639
Jo, I don't know how
things work in florida--

97
00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:36,775
Which, from your description, sounds like

98
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,044
A colorful, lawless swamp.

99
00:03:39,111 --> 00:03:41,112
But here

100
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,315
It takes two men to do one job,

101
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:46,785
Where in florida it might
take one very strong woman

102
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,520
To do such a job. - Whoa...Whoa!

103
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,188
- Whoa, whoa!
- I'll take over.

104
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:52,123
Um, what we're doing here--

105
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,593
Michael handles more of
the big picture stuff,

106
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,329
And I handle more of the day-to-day stuff.

107
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:58,496
- Yeah...
- So together...

108
00:03:58,564 --> 00:04:00,599
- I think I understand.
- All right.

109
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,701
Each of you is doing half a job.

110
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:03,935
- No.
- And sometimes I can

111
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:05,370
Hardly handle that.

112
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:06,738
Now, this is knucklehead talk.

113
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:08,273
I'm not gonna abide it, you know.

114
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:10,208
You can't give me gravy
and tell me it's jelly,

115
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:12,177
'cause gravy ain't sweet... Is it, jim?

116
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:13,678
[whispers] I don't think so.

117
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:15,680
- Michael?
- Forget the question.

118
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:18,049
I think one of you should return to sales

119
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:20,051
And the other one will be manager.

120
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:23,021
I humbly accept the management position.

121
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,023
Why would you just automatically get it?

122
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:26,691
Because...Well, jim,

123
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,893
Where I'm from, there're two types of folk--

124
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,228
Those who ain't,

125
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:32,864
And those who are kne
e-high on a grasshopper.

126
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:35,200
Which type ain't you ain't?

127
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:37,902
Y'all come back now.

128
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,371
Do you even know what that means?

129
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:40,672
Yes.

130
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,774
Well, I'm gonna let this marinate,
so you can go.

131
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:43,775
- Um...
- You can go on.

132
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,010
Yep.

133
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,811
Shoo.

134
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,414
I'm joleen bennett. Jo for short.

135
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:51,316
I'm a breast cancer survivor.

136
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:54,085
Close, personal friends with nancy pelosi,

137
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:56,354
And truman capote and I slept
with three of the same guys.

138
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,890
When I was a little girl,
I was terrified to fly,

139
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,326
And now I have my own pilot's license.

140
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:02,827
I am ceo of sabre international,

141
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:04,329
And I sell the best damn printers

142
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:06,598
And all-in-one machines korea can make.

143
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,999
Pleased to meet you.

144
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,567
Whoa, traffic jam.

145
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:11,236
- Uh-oh! Traffic jam on route 3.

146
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:13,104
- Beep beep!
- Beep beep!

147
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:14,372
20 people dead in a pileup.

148
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,108
There's blood everywhere! [both giggling]

149
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:19,411
Um, I got you a valentine's card.

150
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:21,713
- You did?
- Yep.

151
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,882
Oh, a bird and a dog.

152
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,517
Yeah, well, it's snoopy and woodstock.

153
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:28,553
- You named them?
- Uh, charles schulz did.

154
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,921
I thought it was relevant

155
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,856
'cause I got you all those
birds for christmas.

156
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:33,692
Remember? - Uh, yeah, I do remember.

157
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,794
Aw, they love each other.

158
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,295
Oh, look at that. They sure do.

159
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:38,630
I hadn't noticed.

160
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:40,932
Oh, it smells really good too.

161
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,334
Yeah. It's roger federer for men.

162
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,535
I sprayed some in there.

163
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:46,638
Andy, whoa! Thank you very much.

164
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:48,773
It's got pheromones in it.

165
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:50,075
- Hey.
- Hi.

166
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,876
Uh...Just choosin' seats.

167
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:53,378
Not getting married.

168
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:55,447
Chop-chop, little onion.

169
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:57,282
Jo, there's books in my chair.

170
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,650
That's right, darling.

171
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:01,052
Now you're the proud new
owner of a sabre handbook

172
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,722
And my autobiography.

173
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,157
Now, you all must be in a tizzy.

174
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,460
I can see it on your faces.
I mean, what's going on now?

175
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:10,895
I mean, who owns dunder mifflin, right?

176
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:13,665
I mean, sabre? What's that?

177
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,400
Some company we never heard of

178
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:17,602
From down in tallahassee?

179
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,472
Where is that? Near mars?

180
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,774
No, we know. Texas.

181
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,310
Now, dunder mifflin has an arm's reach

182
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:28,012
Into all these small businesses
all over the northeast.

183
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,415
And now we're gonna take that arm...

184
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:34,085
And we're gonna start selling...

185
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:35,453
Printers.

186
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,122
I could manage my way around that.

187
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,923
They're the easiest to
use printers in the market.

188
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,826
I will try to manage my excitement.

189
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:45,497
I have been saying the word "manager" a lot

190
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:49,968
So whenever jo thinks manager,
she thinks of me.

191
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,370
Camel cigarettes did the
same thing with joe camel

192
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:54,439
By making him look like a penis.

193
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,808
I can't even go near a cigarette now

194
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,443
Without thinking of a penis.

195
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:00,044
And vice versa.

196
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,479
I think that's it.

197
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,314
So we're all good.

198
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,450
Thanks, y'all. - I, um...

199
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:13,958
Oh, my god.

200
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,693
I guess andy likes me.

201
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:17,695
I never thought of him in that way.

202
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,297
But I guess in most romantic comedies,

203
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:20,799
The guy you're supposed to be with

204
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:22,867
Is the one that you never
thought of in that way.

205
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:24,602
You might have even thought he was annoying

206
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,372
Or possibly homosexual.

207
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640
So check this out.

208
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:30,275
According to the handbook,

209
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:32,010
You could make more money as a salesman

210
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,244
Than as a manager.

211
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:34,913
They have all these incentive programs.

212
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,748
I ran your numbers from last year.

213
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:39,217
i>- This is way more than I make now.</i>

214
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:40,919
I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager.

215
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:42,987
You know, some people say
they're not in it for the money.

216
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:44,956
Well, with all due respect to this job,

217
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,958
I think I'm definitely in it for the money.

218
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:49,060
And, quite honestly, the women.

219
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:51,362
[click] hey. Got a second?

220
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,264
- Sure.
- All right.

221
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:54,466
What, are you here to tell me

222
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,301
That you think I would be a better manager

223
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:58,403
And that you are sorry
for being such a jerk?

224
00:07:58,471 --> 00:07:59,904
Actually...Yeah.

225
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,773
What?

226
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:02,774
Exactly that.

227
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:04,108
I think that you

228
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:07,712
Absolutely deserve the manager
position more than I do.

229
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,080
[laughs] what?

230
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:11,282
Really? - Yeah.

231
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,351
[laughing] wow! Wow!

232
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,788
* la la la la, hello, oscar *

233
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:18,256
Michael. Reading.

234
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:20,358
<i>- What are you reading?
- The atlantic.</i>

235
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:22,627
Oh, that is my favorite ocean--I love it!

236
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:24,195
I'm so happy right now.

237
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,698
No! I can't keep it a secret any longer.

238
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:28,099
Jim's stepping down to salesman.

239
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,768
I am going to be the
sole manager once again.

240
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,604
I should step into sales myself.

241
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:34,572
Why? Is there an untapped gay market?

242
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,408
Sabre has no caps on commissions.

243
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:41,379
<i>He can make a lot more
money in sales.</i>

244
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:46,784
Where did you get that information?

245
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:48,052
Manual.

246
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,487
Manuel who?

247
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:52,557
Mm-hmm. Well, according to the manual,

248
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,759
There is no cap on commissions.

249
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,195
I have been hustled.

250
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:00,932
[quietly] son of a bitch.

251
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,767
Pardon me. - Oh. Speak of the devil.

252
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,270
We were just talking about you. Have a seat.

253
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,305
- Okay.
- Now, jim here is, uh...

254
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:09,641
Thinking about taking
himself out of the running

255
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,642
For being manager.

256
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:11,643
- Yep.
- Really?

257
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,113
Oh, that is so sweet of you!

258
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,915
But...

259
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:20,018
I cannot accept, because I
have been thinking about it,

260
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:22,186
And I think I want to go back to sales.

261
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:23,354
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:24,522
- Really?
- Yeah.

263
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,090
You can take the man out of the salesman,

264
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:27,659
But you can't take the
sales out of salesman.

265
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,694
Well, I think you're both
being a little too modest.

266
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:31,129
No, I really, really think michael

267
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,598
Is better at being manager
for so many reasons.

268
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,133
- Mm
-mm. No.

269
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,668
I think I would be bad.

270
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:39,070
I...Would sleep in my office,

271
00:09:39,138 --> 00:09:40,672
And I would sexually harass people.

272
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:42,473
Why would you do that?

273
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,309
I'm turning myself in right now.

274
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,577
You know, michael,

275
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:47,478
You have more experience
in sales and management,

276
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,980
So I'm gonna defer to your judgment.

277
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,782
Thank you.

278
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:52,650
I think you will become the salesman,

279
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,786
And congratulations...

280
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:57,488
You're gonna be the new
manager of this branch!

281
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,489
Great! That's great.

282
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,991
Congratulations.

283
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,561
[quietly] have fun signing
my commission checks, boss.

284
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,352
Oh! Michael marked his heights.

285
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,154
He's...Grown.

286
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:13,290
Mm. [both chuckle]

287
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:18,795
Bobcat, this is dragon.

288
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:21,531
Listen, he's been promoted to sole manager.

289
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,233
We have got to step this up.

290
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,236
Meet me behind the dumpster in 90 seconds.

291
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:28,872
89, 88...

292
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:31,508
You're 20 minutes late.

293
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:32,509
Um...

294
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:34,077
I was at another dumpster.

295
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:36,012
Just admit you lost track of time.

296
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,814
Ryan and I have been meeting up

297
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:40,216
To work on our diabolical plot against jim.

298
00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:42,685
Ryan is always late for our meetings.

299
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:45,989
I wish I had a lair.

300
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:47,657
i>- Did you see saw?</i>

301
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:50,326
Course I seesaw.
Mose and I seesaw all the time.

302
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:51,628
No. Uh, the movie.

303
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:53,997
<i>Did you see the movie saw?</i>

304
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:55,498
Oh. Yeah. Great film.

305
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,367
Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.

306
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:00,069
Okay, the reason these
movies are so popular

307
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:03,339
Is the element of psychological torment.

308
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:05,275
I like where you're going with this.

309
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:06,676
Continue.

310
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:09,679
Can we lure him into an
old warehouse or something?

311
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:10,680
I have an old barn.

312
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:11,948
It's kinda smelly... - Yes!

313
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:13,416
But that might be a plus. Okay, then what?

314
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:16,419
i>- We do what they did in saw.</i>

315
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:21,090
I mean, we don't kill him, obviously.

316
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:22,492
- I don't--
- I have a mask...

317
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,428
Okay. That's your idea?
Exactly like in the movie?

318
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:28,231
That is the most idiotic thing
I have ever heard in my life!

319
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:30,233
Well, suggest something
else then, don't just--

320
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:31,668
He's supposed to cut his leg off?

321
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:33,036
- Don't just criticize my idea!
- Think!

322
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:36,439
You think of something then!

323
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:37,941
Michael, I'm worried that, uh,

324
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:40,076
Not all your toys are gonna
fit on your new desk.

325
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:41,477
How is that possible?

326
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:42,712
Well, in your old office,

327
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,514
There were all those
ledges and extra space--

328
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:45,882
No excuses, erin. Come on!

329
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,717
Make it happen.

330
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:49,986
You know, I actually think
that I should get back to work.

331
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:52,622
Jim asked me to do some stuff,
and he's manager.

332
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,692
Oh. Yeah. Fine, fine.

333
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,693
- Okay.
- Leave it here.

334
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,861
All right.

335
00:11:57,928 --> 00:11:59,796
I have to make some sales anyway.

336
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:02,031
Who should I call with
my magic sales fingers?

337
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:05,735
[telephone rings]

338
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,570
[ringing]

339
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:09,706
Michael scott, head of sales.

340
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:13,176
You gotta do something, man.
You can't just sit there.

341
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:18,815
The new I.T. Guy.

342
00:12:18,883 --> 00:12:20,617
Nick.

343
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:22,085
- Nick.
- I think he's the key.

344
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:24,254
He's very trusting.
He's looking for friends.

345
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:26,489
He's been given an awesome amount of power

346
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:28,458
And does not know how to wield it.

347
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:30,326
Like frodo.

348
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:32,962
Why don't you just let me
handle the tolkien references,

349
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,464
Okay, dumb jock?

350
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:36,833
Well, I think he can be corrupted.

351
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:38,735
Like gollum.

352
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:41,104
Smeagol was corrupted

353
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:42,805
And became gollum.

354
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:44,807
<i>I might start a diabolical
plot against him</i>

355
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,142
After this one.

356
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,078
Who's hungry?

357
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:50,680
- What is that?
- That's ants on a log.

358
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:53,349
Michael would always have
me bring them in at 2:30

359
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:55,451
And say, "who's hungry?" - [laughs] oh.

360
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,487
I'm fine. Thank you, though.

361
00:12:57,554 --> 00:12:59,489
Do you want me to spin you in
your chair and make you dizzy?

362
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,491
- Why would I want to do that?
- It's a thinking technique.

363
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:03,426
All the top executives do it.

364
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:05,028
It keeps the brain moving,

365
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:07,630
And a...Spinning brain is a working brain.

366
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:10,133
For now, I'm just gonna
go back to work here.

367
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,434
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah. Thank you.

368
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,370
Well...

369
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:16,673
It will be a pleasure
doing business with you.

370
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,509
Thanks. Bye-bye.

371
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:21,678
[train whistle sound]

372
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:23,046
I just got a new account.

373
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:25,949
The gentleman's club in carbondale.

374
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,684
It is called curves.

375
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:29,552
I went by there the other day.

376
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,187
Saw some of the women walking in.

377
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:32,855
Not...Really my cup of tea.

378
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:34,958
Actually, kevin, you might like it.

379
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:36,859
Nice.

380
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:39,028
You know, we really
don't announce out loud

381
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:40,463
Our sales that much.

382
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:42,732
Why not? It's part of
the sales experience.

383
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,367
It's not really 1992 anymore.

384
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:45,501
Well, okay.

385
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,236
[laughter]

386
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:50,873
"you brighten my day with
the sound of your voice.

387
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:52,675
"you bring so much laughter and love.

388
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:54,010
"you're everything to me,

389
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:56,713
And I was so blessed when
god sent you here to me."

390
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,747
- Jeez louise.
- I know.

391
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,816
Obsessed with me much?

392
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:02,685
- Well, everyone got one.
- What did yours say?

393
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:05,488
"friends are worth
sharing a doghouse with."

394
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:07,357
It's no wonder

395
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:09,559
That andy gave kelly such a romantic card.

396
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:11,294
I can't compete with her.

397
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:13,296
That girl can sing and dance

398
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:15,765
And gets all of her clothes at the mall...

399
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,700
And I feel like such a fool

400
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,769
For thinking that andy was
only going after one girl.

401
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,171
'cause andy bernard is a playboy,

402
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:24,540
And why shouldn't he be?

403
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:27,610
He's got it all.

404
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:31,948
Ho ho. There he is, the I.T. Guy.

405
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:34,083
See you discovered the break room.

406
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:35,752
- Uh, yep.
- I imagine

407
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:37,553
One of the best things
about being an I.T. Guy

408
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:39,589
Is you get to know everyone's
computer passwords.

409
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,924
You know, I actually don't.

410
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:43,192
[all laugh]

411
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,128
Listen. I know you have to say that,

412
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:47,463
But we got a little problem here.

413
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:49,198
There is a employee named jim halpert,

414
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:51,334
And he's doi some terrible things, okay?

415
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:53,669
He's molesting people via the internet,

416
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:55,705
And we need to stop him.

417
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:58,207
I think that you should call the cops--

418
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:01,010
No. The cops called us.

419
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,914
So I'm gonna need you
to give me the password

420
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:06,749
To jim halpert's computer.

421
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:08,584
I don't know what to tell you,
man, I'm sorry.

422
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:10,353
I just can't give out
his password like that.

423
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:13,089
Nick, we could make things very...

424
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:15,758
Very difficult for you.

425
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:17,660
Are you...

426
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:19,095
You threatening me?

427
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,297
Threatening you?

428
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:23,499
No.

429
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,813
What is that smell? Do you smell that?

430
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,749
What is that?

431
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:41,484
Like a sulfur deposit under here?

432
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:43,319
Michael...Stop.

433
00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:45,655
No, I'm serious. We don't have to put up--

434
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:47,757
Is it the dogs? - [whispers] michael.

435
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:48,925
You know what?

436
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,059
We don't have to deal with this.

437
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:52,595
I'm going to google sulfur maps.

438
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:56,599
Michael, it's phyllis.

439
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,367
No, this is geological.

440
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,770
I sent an email out
to everyone in this area

441
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:02,939
That this might be a side effect

442
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:05,575
To my new allergy medication I'm on.

443
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:08,211
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

444
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:12,448
And you guys are okay with this?

445
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:14,150
She sent an email...

446
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:34,403
It's not 'cause of the smell.

447
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:37,373
I'm just expecting a nosebleed.

448
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:40,176
Oh, my god.

449
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,669
Oh...[giggling] you scared me.

450
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:47,170
I'm sorry. I thought you saw me.

451
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:49,339
I didn't see you.

452
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,909
And you were there all along.

453
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,378
Well, I warmed it up for you.

454
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:55,679
So should be good to go.

455
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:56,880
Cool. Thanks.

456
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:59,983
Bye, andy.

457
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,323
- That was weird.
- No, it ain't.

458
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,825
We all saw the valentine you gave her.

459
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,861
I don't even know what that card said.

460
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,863
Believe me, if I got that card,

461
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:17,367
We'd be in the bathroom
doing it right...Now.

462
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:18,936
Oh!

463
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,540
Hey.

464
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,009
Hey.

465
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:27,611
You know, it's funny,
I used to stand in here

466
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,580
And wish I was out there.

467
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:31,348
Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.

468
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,950
Well, the grass is always greener.

469
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,786
Yeah. Except there's no grass out there.

470
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,088
It's just a farty dirt patch.

471
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,623
Well, it's what you wanted.

472
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,558
I really need my job back.

473
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,560
We made a terrible mistake here.

474
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:46,129
For the record, I fought this, all right?

475
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:48,765
And now...I'm not really sure what we do.

476
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,935
We make a poster that
says "happy opposite day,"

477
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:53,637
And she sees it on the way out--

478
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,638
That's stupid.

479
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,607
Oh, I wish we had one of those

480
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,610
<i>Amnesia flashlights from men
in black and just--</i>

481
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,411
Hey, what was that movie

482
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,380
Where their boss was within earshot,

483
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,882
And they could have just
gone and talked to her?

484
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,284
<i>- Lethal weapon?
- That's it.</i>

485
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,252
<i>I think we should do it the
lethal weapon way.</i>

486
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,555
You two are grown-ass men.
What do I have to do,

487
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,790
Fire you and get two people in here

488
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:15,392
Who don't need so much management?

489
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,327
Wha...? What I'm saying--

490
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,396
Michael's saying that he's
better at being a manager,

491
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:21,264
And I agree, because he's
a better people person,

492
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:22,566
Weird--weirdly. - And weirdly,

493
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,601
I'm a good dog person, right, guys?

494
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,003
See? They love me.

495
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,972
Fine. I don't care which
one of you does which job.

496
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,808
Just...Stop meetin' with
me to talk about it.

497
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:32,809
All right.

498
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,811
All right.

499
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,812
[cell phone rings] - oh.

500
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,648
I gotta take this.

501
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:40,150
Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me.

502
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:44,688
And don't ride 'em.
Lotta people try to ride 'em.

503
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,494
'scuse me, everyone.
Please check your emails.

504
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,130
I just sent you the following message:

505
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:55,432
"coworkers, you may have
received a valentine from me.

506
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,534
"please understand this does not mean

507
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,336
That I like you in any way."

508
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,605
You don't even like us as friends?

509
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,307
Phyllis, you guys are
like my closest friends.

510
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,044
<i>I just mean I don't like like you.</i>

511
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,478
What are we, five?

512
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:09,913
"please don't read into this card.

513
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,816
Yours, in professionalism, nard dog."

514
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,118
Um, why did I just receive
a mass email from you

515
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:17,020
That said that you don't like me?

516
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,389
Do you realize how hard that
makes me like you, andy?

517
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,124
It's--

518
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,326
That wasn't--

519
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,629
I like someone else.

520
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,731
Who?

521
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,132
[snorts]

522
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,636
It's...Not...

523
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:36,173
Whether or not...

00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:38,842
Who? What?

526
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,412
Yeah, I guess andy never liked kelly.

527
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,347
How about that?

528
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:46,216
[inhales]

529
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:48,085
Oh, it smells good in here.

530
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:51,021
It sure does. Okay, we have your...

531
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,490
Space heater, your humidifier,
your dehumidifier,

532
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:56,093
Your fan, your foot fan,
and your food dehydrator.

533
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,162
Erin...What about my keyboard?

534
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,666
[soft electronic music]

535
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,735
Ah.

536
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:06,136
So good to be home.

537
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,605
* *

538
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:09,940
How 'bout a little bossa nova?

539
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:12,175
Oh...

540
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:15,145
[bossa nova plays]

541
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:22,953

542
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,255
He looks happy.

543
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,690
Yep.

544
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,059
Well, well, well. Hmm.

545
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,028
Boss for...What was it?

546
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:35,031
Oh...4 1/2 hours?

547
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,434
New record... Low.

548
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,103
Previous record, henry rostin.

549
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:41,538
Boss for nine years, four months.

550
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:42,973
And he only left

551
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,708
Because he had family matters to attend to,

552
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,143
And he--what--

553
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,717
Michael?

554
00:20:56,106 --> 00:20:57,273
I can't help but think

555
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,900
That something we did made this possible.
