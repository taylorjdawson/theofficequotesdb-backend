understand why you

wanted me to say that.

I still have the
lease on the Michael
Scott Paper Company,

00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:15,405
so occasionally, I will
sneak down here for a
little coffee and dancing.

all the time.

around corporate,
it is a ballet.

I'm break dancing.

because look at
this normal-sized

Anybody want to
go to lunch with
me later on?

28

I do.
Okay, how about
a woman? Pam?

you an e-mail.

early today to meet
with our contractor.

and I don't know
who instituted it.

I think it started right
after my predecessor
stepped down.

having lunch with Pam

with these people.

a handful of reasons

would ever go to a

00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,441
Boss, this used to
hang from my windshield,
but it belongs in here.

341
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,412
Hey, thank you, Creed.
You really get this place.

342
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,383
No problem.
I'll just have no idea
who's driving behind me now.

343
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,247
Look out.

344
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,315
(EXCLAIMING)

345
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,629
Yeah!
Yeah.

346
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,202
Yeah!
Finish it off.

347
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,769
Oh, no! Oh, no!

348
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,470
Here we go.
Okay, something's
gonna happen.

349
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,137
(ALL CHEERING)

350
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,578
MICHAEL: Here we go. Yeah.

351
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,020
(EXCLAIMING)

352
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,368
I'm going to go
with the python.

353
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,204
But the rattler's so scary.

354
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:29,008
No, please, I find
the rattle soothing.
Puts me to sleep.

355
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,982
I think Bob's
going to cheat on me
with his new secretary.

356
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,513
(LAUGHING)

357
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,017
What's so funny?

358
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,653
When I say
it out loud,
it's so silly.

359
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,286
(BOTH LAUGHING)

360
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,202
Hey, hey, Angela, no.
No cleaning up.

361
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,704
You are forcing me
to be down here.

362
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,329
Am I not allowed
to have some fun?

363
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,170
No cleaning up.

364
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,250
These are for you.

365
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,417
They're beautiful.

366
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,123
You ready?
Yeah.

367
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,965
(MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE)

368
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,541
We should probably
stop by. It would
mean a lot to him.

369
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:46,085
Hey. Hey. Man,
Jim and Pam.

370
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,152
Can you believe this?
It's really happening.

371
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,727
Want to dance, Dwight?

372
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,528
Ordinarily,
I would say no,

373
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,035
but you need to
move to reduce
lactic acid buildup.

374
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,935
Also, this song
is fantastic.

375
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,131
Mind if I steal my wife?

376
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,176
You can't steal
what is legally
your property.

377
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,547
Are those staples?

378
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,716
This dance
competition
is not over.

379
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,244
What dance competition?
I was just dancing casually
with my friend, y'all.

380
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,722
(LAUGHING) Yeah, right.

381
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,854
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

382
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,641
You guys are the
best for coming.

383
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,973
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.
I understand.

384
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,740
JIM: We're going to stay.
Really?

385
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,781
At least for
one more dance.

386
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,081
No, not me.
Not me. Get out
of here. Cafe Disco.

387
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,645
Hey, come on, man.
We're not even to "Y."

388
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,122
This is so cheesy.

389
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,318
Yes.

390
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,996
I like cheesy.

391
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,192
Me, too.

392
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:09,105
You know,
I think maybe I want
a wedding wedding.

393
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,200
Me, too.

394
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,800
Really?
Yeah.

395
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,648
Would you like
to dance?

396
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,119
No.

397
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,698
ANDY: Yeah. No,
well, okay...
KELLY: Stop squirming.

398
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,631
Well, stop trying
to poke me with
a sharp thing.

399
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,727
You wanted to
do this, okay?
Just be brave.

400
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,135
I know, but you're
not a professional,

401
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,695
and I'm thinking
maybe we should
have gone that route.

402
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,365
I'm doing...
No, I'm doing
it for free.

403
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,602
Just... You have
to stop squirming,

404
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,802
otherwise, I'm
going to mess up.

405
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,367
Are you sure
that's not the
gay ear?

406
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,004
Gay ear?
Are you 12 years old?

407
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,139
Well, I...

408
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,409
Look, I'm going to
count to three.

409
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,507
Count to 20.

410
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,348
No, I'm going to
count to three.
One, two, three.

411
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,910
(SCREAMING) Son of a bitch!

412
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,014
Andy, that was
just the ice.

413
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,490
It was?
Yeah, it was.
