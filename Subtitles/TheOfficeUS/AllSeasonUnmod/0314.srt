after many record-breaking years,

00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:09,964

and it's very exciting.

Yeah, well, it is a big loss.
Dwight was the top salesman.

Was the top salesman.
I said "was."

That is impossible.

That's very funny.

Yeah.

No, no.

and I've thought about certain things,

71
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:21,651
and I'm sorry for the way
those certain events transpired.

72

about certain things.

if they stopped watering it?

84
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:04,531
Yeah. Oh, you know what?
Ask them about the toys on my desk, too.

85
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:08,897
They always used to arrange the toys
on my desk in a very pleasing way.

There's something about him
that creeps me out.

105

I can't really explain it.

can have so little self-awareness.

Michael...
No. No, I mean, not because you're gay.

114
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:52,375
Your gayness does not define you.

115
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:55,310
Your Mexicanness is what defines you
to me.

116
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:58,940

Oscar's Mexicanity.

Zombie, Zombie

In your head

179
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:42,171
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?

180
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,366
I'm kind of in the middle... Yes, please.

181
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:46,534
Okay, good. Stay right here.

182
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,277

In your head

184
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:54,780
Sorry about that.
Oh, smooth move, Tuna.

185
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:56,742
Nice one.

186
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:02,825
Are there any messages?
No.

187
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,326
So weird.

188
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:09,897
Nice to have Oscar back.

189
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:13,260
Yeah.

(MUSIC PLAYING ON CELL PHONE)

191
00:11:57,748 --> 00:12:00,080
He rocks in the treetop all a day long

192
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,778
Hoppin' and a-boppin'
and a-singin' the song

193
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:08,950
Large Tuna,
have you seen my cell phone device?

194
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:13,126
No.
'Cause someone is calling right now.

195
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:14,353
There is a call.

196
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:16,729
... well you really gonna rock tonight

197
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:18,995
Every little swallow...

198
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,140
Angela.

199
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,589
Is everything okay?

200
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:43,150
No.

201
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:50,999
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

202
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:53,731
He rocks in the treetop...

203
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:55,237
What's going on?

204
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,670
What're you talking about?

205
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,800
Where is my freaking phone?

206
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,706
Love to hear the robin goin'...

207
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,474
You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling.

208
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,981
You know what?
Maybe you're in the ceiling.

209
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,347
Okay.

210
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:10,914
ANDY: I don't trust you, Phyllis.

211
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,983
Every little swallow, every chickadee

212
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,186
I wanted to let you know that
Dwight was late that morning

213
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,889
because he had to drive to New York
to drop off the quarterly tax forms

214
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,019
that I forgot to send.

215
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,768
Why would Dwight do that for you?

216
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:27,768
I think I know why.

217
00:13:27,838 --> 00:13:29,806
Because Dwight loves this company.

218
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:34,737
Do you think that anyone else out there
would've driven to corporate for you?

219
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:39,040
None of them. Especially not Andy.

220
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:44,481
Oh rockin' robin
well you really gonna rock tonight

221
00:13:57,034 --> 00:14:00,561
Pam, I have a mission to accomplish.
Make sure this party gets rolling

222
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:02,195
and I will be back shortly.

223
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,174
Where are you going?
Want me to come with?

224
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:08,678
Listen, I forgot to tell you the plan
for this Saturday.

225
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:11,977
You, me, bar, beers, buzzed.

226
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:15,615
Wings, shots, drunk. Waitresses, hot.

227
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:18,549
Football, Cornell, Hofstra. Slaughter.

228
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,788
Then, quick nap at my place
and we hit the tizzown.

229
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:24,327
No. I don't wanna do any of that.

230
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:28,329
Duh.
Which is why I was joking about doing it.

231
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,529
No, just stop. Stop. Just stop doing it.
You're going to drive me crazy.

232
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:37,296
Fine, I'll just go sit at my desk and be quiet.

233
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,171
Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.

234
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:43,069
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

235
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:46,079
Excuse me.

He rocks in the treetop all a day long

237
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:53,380
And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here
for some reason think it's funny

238
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:56,858
to steal someone's personal property
and hide it from them.

239
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,585
Here's a little news flash.

240
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:01,228
It's not funny!

241
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:05,095
In fact, it's pretty freaking un-funny!

242
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:08,670
Every little swallow, every chickadee

243
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,168
God!

The wise old owl and the big black crow

246
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:15,039
Flapping them wings...

247
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:20,313
That was an overreaction.

248
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:23,581
Gonna hit the break room.
Does anybody want anything?

249
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,519
Pam, you good?

250
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,482
Yeah.
Sure? Okay.

251
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,672
DWIGHT: Well, that question is meaningless.

252
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:54,410
Just go with the copy paper,
it's your funeral.

253
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,476
See how that works out for you.

254
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:00,984
Hey.

255
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,188
Hey.
What's up?

256
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:08,121
Same old.

257
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:22,236
It takes a big man to admit his mistake,
and I am that big man.

258
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,344
Angela from accounting
told me what you did.

259
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:29,083
Oh, my God, she told you?
Yes, she did.

260
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:30,550
And, Dwight,

261
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:36,385
if you were willing to do something like that
for some random co-worker,

262
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,828
then clearly, I misjudged you
from the beginning.

263
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:45,030
And I apologize.

264
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:49,702
Accepted.

265
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:56,502
How's this place treating you?

266
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:59,409
My boss isn't funny.

267
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:02,178
I don't get to wear my ties.
No.

268
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:04,286
Sure.
So...

269
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:06,652
So maybe you should come back.

270
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,325
You should come back. Please.

271
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,089
I don't wanna do your laundry anymore.

272
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,400
We can talk about that.

273
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:25,873
All right.

274
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:36,280
(MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

275
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:40,250
Oh, my God. That's half-inch dry wall.

276
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,882
I think we broke his brain.

277
00:17:44,795 --> 00:17:47,127
JIM: "It's not freaking funny!"

278
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:52,635
You really enjoying your fiesta?
Actually, yeah.

279
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:55,934
I didn't think I would but turns out it's great.

280
00:17:56,006 --> 00:18:00,204
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present Mr. Dwight Schrute.

281
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:08,682
Welcome back.
Thank you.

282
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:16,856
Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand.
You're gonna break it.

283
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:18,960
Not bad, huh?

284
00:18:20,197 --> 00:18:21,721
You did this for me?

285
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:25,166
Guilty.

286
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:32,864
Hey.

287
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:41,483
Do you still have feelings for her?

288
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:49,816
Yes.

289
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:09,069
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the big finale.

290
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:11,774
Sir, would you do the honor?

291
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:13,975
Oh, man.

292
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:19,149
No, no, no, no. I don't need it.

293
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:23,055
(YELLING)

294
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:30,530
MICHAEL: It takes a big man to admit
his mistake and that's what I did.

295
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,962
The important thing is, I learned something.

296
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:38,406
I don't want somebody sucking up to me

297
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:41,342
because they think
I'm going to help their career.

298
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:47,879
I want them sucking up to me
because they genuinely love me.

299
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,882
So Michael had a little chat with corporate

300
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,189
and they decided to send me
to management training.

301
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:03,789
Anger management, technically,
but still, management material.

302
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:05,992
This whole thing's supposed to take
10 weeks.

303
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:07,263
I expect to be done in five.

304
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:11,671
How? Name repetition, personality mirroring
and positive reinforcement

305
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,801
through nods and smiles.

306
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:17,710
So don't worry about old Andy Bernard.
I'll be back.

307
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:19,242
Just like Rambo.

308
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:20,408
Oh, hi, you must be Andy.

309
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:23,885
Oh, hi. Yes, I am, and you must be Marcy.

310
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:26,946
That's right, it's so good to meet you.
It's so good to meet you.

311
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:29,355
Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun?
Yeah.
