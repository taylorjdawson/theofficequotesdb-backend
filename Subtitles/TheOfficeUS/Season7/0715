have your attention?

Ryan and I have a huge announcement.

3
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:08,014
Oh my gosh.
Wow.

00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,197
Over the weekend,
Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced.

- Free ring.

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:14,989
Divorced?

7
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,629
Just so you know, it's totally amicable.
We're fine.

8
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:19,631
We don't need people here
to take sides.

9
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:21,833
The last thing that we want
is any kind of drama.

10
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,902

Can you back up?

12
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:27,071
We were having a beautiful
weekend in the Poconos.

13
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:29,073
We were making love constantly.

14
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,809
We saw the sun rise,
and Ryan was crying a lot.

15

00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:36,080
we walked by a chapel
and we stopped suddenly,

17
00:00:36,148 --> 00:00:37,582
and Ryan said...

18
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,651
Both: "I don't think I should
be married to you anymore."

19
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:42,420
Wait, wha...

20
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:44,255
Sorry, when did you get married?

21
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:45,757
Um, like a week ago.

22
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,358
We got really wasted,
and it just felt right.

23
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:49,127

24
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:50,695
We are getting divorced, Andy!

25
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:53,331
This is such a raw time.

26
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,966
God, baby, you know,
with people's reactions to this,

27
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:56,668
I wonder if we made a mistake.

28
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:59,204
No, with the messed-up laws
in this country,

29
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:02,840
I don't want to be married
until everyone can be married.

You know what, Ryan?

31
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:05,210
I talked to the other gay guys,

32
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:06,611
and we're okay with it.

33
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:07,879

for you to get married.

Okay, fine.
You know what?

isn't amicable at all,

179
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:33,804
Did the phone cut out?

180
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:35,072
Nope.

181
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,074
All right, just call me
after the doctor.

182
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:38,142
- Okay.
- All right, bye.

183
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,143
Bye.

184
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:40,411
I know, I know.

185
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,913
You have a phone policy.
I understand.

186
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,080
But this is an emergency,

187
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:44,448
because my friend isn't here,

188
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:48,286
and I'm worried
that he has been abducted.

189
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:49,854
- No.
- And... and...

190
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:52,323
No, he ditched you, man.
I saw him drive away.

191
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,125
There's no way he ditched me.

192
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:55,459
There's no way that happened.

193
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:56,827
He's my... Okay.

194
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:58,429
May I please just
use your phone? Please.

195
00:06:58,497 --> 00:06:59,530
Just make it quick.

196
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:00,865
[Whispers]
Thank you. Okay.

197
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,234
I will make it quick.
I will make it very quick.

198
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:06,737
And you don't have my numbers
on speed dial.

199
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:09,807
Aah, okay, what is it?

200
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,808
You don't know.

201
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:11,976
- Oh, co... come...
- You don't.

202
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:13,144
You know what?

203
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:14,345
I could dial 411,
get Jim's number...

204
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:17,782
He left you here
on purpose, all right?

205
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,016
I saw it.

206
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:20,484
He just drove away.

207
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:22,019
Actually, this is good.

208
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:25,022
I am going
to take this opportunity

209
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,193
to go walkabout.

210
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:32,797
Good, good.

211
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:34,298
No, get away.

212
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:37,969
No. That's enough.

213
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:41,372
Okay.

214
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,007
Okay.

215
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:44,809
It's the gas station
on Bennett Street?

216
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:45,810
Yeah.

217
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:46,911
You know what?

218
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,079
Why don't you stay and I'll go?

219
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:49,347
Oh, no, no, no, I'll be fine.

220
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:51,115
It's kind of a sketchy
neighborhood, though.

221
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:52,116
I better come along.

222
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:54,085
Problem solved, everyone.

223
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:55,987
Space Orphan
and Princess Nincompoop

224
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:57,188
are off to rescue Michael.

225
00:07:57,255 --> 00:07:59,457
Unbelievable.
I'm going.

226
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:01,459
You drive.
I got a car full of fox meat.

227
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:03,027
[Sniffs]

228
00:08:05,564 --> 00:08:07,732
Cute.

229
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,005
Very funny, everyone.

230
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:16,941
Who wrote captions
under my doodle?

231
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:19,043
I'm not even kidding.
They're pretty good.

232
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:20,878
- Which one in particular?
- Yeah, which one?

233
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:23,948
Well, the first one
has a surprise factor.

234
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:26,217
"I'm a suck-suck-suckety Sabre."

235
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:27,218
Boo-yah!

236
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:29,120
[Laughter]
No. No, no.

237
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:30,221
No, no, no.

238
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:32,323
But, uh, I suppose the second one

239
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,524
is the better written line.

240
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:35,993
- You suppose?
- What's it say?

241
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:37,595
"I'm supposed
to be wearing red gloves,

242
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:40,431
but my color cartridge portal
got jammed again."

243
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,034
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

244
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,268
[Laughs]
Gloves.

245
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,703
Keep it real.

246
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:47,605
You guys, if I knew you
wanted to do a caption contest,

247
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:49,373
I would have drawn
something more challenging.

248
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,842
- And I will take you all down.
- You?

249
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,377
I been reading
the comics to my daughter

250
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,046
since she was three years old.

251
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:57,615
Not once have I used the real
captions to <i>Family Circus.</i>

252
00:08:57,683 --> 00:09:00,251
That crazy family is hilarious
to her for one reason...

253
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:01,619
Me.

254
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,154
Oh, it is on

255
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:06,290
like Genghis Khan
wearing Sean John in Bhutan.

256
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:09,093
Yes. You guys,
I have the perfect idea.

257
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:10,561
Okay, it'll just
take me ten minutes.

258
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:12,029
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right.

259
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:13,097
I want to do it.

260
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:15,966
Male, Caucasian, 40s, black hair,

261
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,736
facial type marsupial.

262
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:21,005
He answers to Michael,
Michael G. Scott,

263
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:23,240
Michael J. Fox, Mr. Fox,
the Incredible Mr. Fox.

264
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,509
- Yeah, he just left.
- Which way did he go?

265
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,778
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let me answer this.

266
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:29,947
Stupid question.
He went back to the office,

267
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,148
obviously, which is that way.

268
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:32,283
Oh, really?

269
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,851
You don't think
he walked by that bakery

270
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,386
just for the smell of it?

271
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:38,689
She's right.
He went that way.

272
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:40,791
All right.

273
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:44,595
Don't get a swelled head.
You're no tracker.

274
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:46,664
Let's ride.

275
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:02,916
[Puppies barking]

276
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:04,918
Hey, you guys.
Listen to me.

277
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:06,887
Don't get hung up
on just one girl,

278
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:09,723
because there are a lot
of other girls over there.

279
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,225
Look over there.
See?

280
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:14,828
They look cute.

281
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:15,829
[Imitates parrot]
Hello.

282
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:18,031
You guys are so beautiful.

283
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,467
You're so colorful.

284
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,469
I wish I could understand you.

285
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:24,671
That's a metaphor, I guess.

286
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,640
You are disgusting.

287
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,875
You'll never find love.

288
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:30,143
Lecch.

289
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,612
Do you think she needs more time,

290
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,046
or it's just never gonna happen?

291
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:35,449
I'm being serious.
Seriously.

292
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:36,583
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

293
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:37,851
Has Michael checked in?

294
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,354
- Oh, hey, Dwight.
- I asked you a question.

295
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:42,456
- No, he hasn't.
- Okay, bye.

296
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,291
No, wait, um, hey,
while you're out,

297
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,326
could you pick up some paper
towels and chocolate syrup?

298
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:47,995
We have ice cream,
so I thought we could...

299
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:49,329
Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.

300
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:51,131
This is a manhunt-slash-rescue
mission.

301
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:52,532
Okay, I just...

302
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,368
When you're done,
or any time it's convenient,

303
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:55,769
I just thought
since you're out...

304
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:57,704
Pam, I'm obviously
gonna get that stuff for you,

305
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:58,905
so just shut up.
God.

306
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:01,575
Okay, well, it wasn't ob...
[Dial tone]

307

[Sighs]

309
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:06,813
Tada.

310
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:11,918
Okay, it's two giant dogs
with two giant palm trees

311
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:13,353
on a regular-sized island.

- Yes.
- Okay, I'm sorry,

but I'm gonna have
to shut this down.

- Boo.
- Why?

00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,095
Unless we can all agree
to some ground rules.

317
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:25,032
It's either that
or I can fax this to Jo

318
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:26,633
and let her decide
how to proceed.

319
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,202
Gabe, tell us your stupid rules

320
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,604
so we can start the game.

321

Number one,
and this should be obvious,

322
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:34,641
no captions that insult
the company we work for.

323

Irony is such a critical...

324
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:40,681
Number two,
no pop culture references.

- Seriously?
- Wow.

326
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,451
I think we can all agree

327
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,486
they tend to alienate those
who don't get the reference,

328
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:47,688
making them feel like the other.

329
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:49,122
Wrap it up, Gabe.

330
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,558
Okay, final thing,
and this is a fun one,

331
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:55,495
instead of writing the caption
directly under the picture,

332
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:57,431
let's all try using sticky quips.

333
00:11:57,498 --> 00:12:00,167
All right?
New from Dunder Mifflin-Sabre.

334
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:03,970
Sticky quips are fun,
they're safe, they're handy.

335
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:06,440
I like to use sticky quips
as regular post-it notes

336
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:08,175
when I'm in a fun mood.
[Laughs]

Go get 'em.
Start quipping.

Pam, I think
I'm gonna send you an I.M.

341
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,085
Oh, okay.

342
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:19,286
Send me one too.

343
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:20,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, put me on that.

- Ditto.

I would like a hot dog, please.

347
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:28,895
Now, I don't have any money,

348
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:31,698
so here is what
I would like to do.

349
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:34,101
I leave you here with my watch,

350
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:36,670
and I come back later
and I pay for the hotdog.

351
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:38,105
I'm not a pawn shop.

352
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:41,942
Well, I understand that,
but this is a $45 watch.

353
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:42,943
Wow.

354
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,711
With that, I could buy...

355
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:45,879
Half the menu.

356
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,481
I can't just go
giving away hotdogs.

357
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:48,849
All right.

358
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,051
What do you do with the hotdogs
that you don't sell?

359
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,419
Throw 'em away.

360
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:54,454
Well, okay, instead of
throwing them all away later,

361
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:56,256
why don't you just throw
one away now into my mouth.

362
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:57,357
No.

363
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:00,727
Okay.
You've just lost my business.

364
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:09,903
Hey.

365
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,204
Hey, you were in there forever.

366
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,073
There's too many brands.
Where's Holly?

367
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:15,942
She wandered off like an idiot.

368
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,943
- Hey.
- Hey.

369
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:18,145
What are you doing?

370
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:20,046
Oh, just changing
my cell phone plan.

371
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:22,282
Okay. Okay.
Here you go.

372
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,351
I'll take my free
stress ball too now.

373
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:26,186
Sure thing.
Here you go, miss...

374
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,155
Okay, Fanny Smellmore.

375
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:30,490
- Real original.
- What?

376
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:32,726
You know what? Say hi
to Orville Tootenbacher for me.

377
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,461
Tootenbacher.

378
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:35,796
Orville Tootenbacher,

379
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:37,097
that's Michael's
millionaire character that...

380
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,732
Both:
Farts popcorn.

381
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Of course. He was here.

382
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:44,471
She's the key. Amazing.

383
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:46,339
Holly.

384
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:49,843
Hey, where would you
like to go next?

385
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:53,513
Holly?

386
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:56,783
Are their egg rolls
really that big?

387
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:59,519
Oh, boy.
That was yummy.

388
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:01,562
Thank you so much.

389
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:10,764
You know what? I think
I left my wallet in my car.

390
00:14:10,832 --> 00:14:12,065
Do you mind
if I run out and get it?

391
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,133
- No problem.
- Okay.

392
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:20,473
I'll be right back.

393
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,976
[Sighs]
Okay, you know what?

394
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:26,079
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

395
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:30,050
I don't have my wallet.
And I was...

396
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,885
I was gonna try to dine and dash,

397
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:33,353
and that was stupid,

398
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,622
and I realize I can't do that
to you fine people.

399
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,123
So you can't pay for your food?

400
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,960
Well, I can, but I will have
to come back later tonight

401
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:41,962
and pay you.

402
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,197
But the point is
I did the right thing.

403
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,532
You did not.

404
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,666
You have no money,

405
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:48,134
but you dined,
and you dined so much.

406
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:51,538
Well, the number three
is not such a giant feast.

407
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:52,639
Mr. Chu!

408
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,875
Okay, all right.
You know what?

409
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:57,244
You're trying
to steal food from us?

410
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:58,345
I am not.

411
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:00,213
I just have had a bad day,

412
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:03,717
and I...
Okay.

413
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:05,018
I'll be back later
with the money.

414
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:06,186
I'm just gonna leave right now.

415
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:07,387
You can't.
We'll stop you.

416
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,956
Well, I think
I can get through the door.

417
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,976
Excuse me.
Do you speak English?

418
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,168
We are looking for a man,

419
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:24,605
Michael, this tall,
black hair, Caucasian.

420
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:26,707
[Gasps]
It's Michael!

421
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:31,779
He just left.

422
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:33,947
- You knew!
- What?

423
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:35,682
No. Dwight asked
if I wanted an egg roll.

424
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,384
What... What are you
implying?

425
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:40,320
Uncanny.
Put a pin in that.

426
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,356
Which way did he go?

427
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,925
That guy!
When he leave here,

428
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:47,861
which way did he go?
We looking for him.

429
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:49,997
This way, this way, this way?
I don't know.

430
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,431
Do you know?

431
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:53,133
I think he was heading downtown.

432
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,870
He's heading downtown.

433
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:03,844
So what, no one's even gonna try?

434
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:06,013
- Guess not.
- Oh, come on.

435
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,816
My rules could not possibly
have been that oppressive.

436
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,818
You crushed our spirits, Gabe.

437
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:13,687
Congrats.
You're a big man, huh?

438
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:16,456
Takes a lot to destroy
the creativity

439
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:18,158
of a whole group of people.

440
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,528
[Notification tone]

441
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:24,498
[Laughter]

442
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,301
Hey...

443
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:32,873
[Clicking]
[Whispers] Click the "x".

444
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:34,208
- [Whispers] I'm clicking!
- In the box.

445
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:35,676
I am clicking.

446
00:16:35,743 --> 00:16:37,311
Woman, you've had
a computer for years!

447
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:38,712
- Phyllis!
- Too late!

448
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,849
Oh. Ha.
An I.M. chat.

449
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,417
Very clever.

450
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:46,086
I'll just print that out.

451
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:47,554
Come on, guys.
Grow up.

452
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:50,991
I don't want to be
your babysitter.

453
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:55,229
Ooh.

454
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,112
"Darn it, Bob,
I told you not to buy

455
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,513
a Sabre brand lifeboat."

456
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:15,148
[Laughter]

457
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:17,184
- Nice!
- No, not nice.

458
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,719
Terrible.

459
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:20,721
Doesn't even include
the fact that they're dogs.

460
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,689
- Do the next one.
- "Wake up, Fred.

461
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:24,591
"The power cord
on your Sabre printer

462
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,226
"shocked you into a coma,

463
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:28,228
and you're dreaming you're a dog
on a desert island."

464
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:31,498
Dreaming he's a dog on an island.

465
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:33,000
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.

466
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:35,435
How does the speaker know what
the guy in the coma is dreaming?

467
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:36,970
Well, if you think
it's so easy, Gabe,

468
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:39,106
- why don't you try it?
- Um...

469
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:42,175
You don't have to sniff
my rear end anymore, Bob.

470
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:44,011
I'm the only one here.
Ha.

471
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:45,279
That's tasteless, Gabe.

472
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:46,880
- Tasteless?
- Tasteless.

473
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:47,948
More tasteless than this?

474
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:49,316
"Is that a palm tree,

475
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:50,817
"or did Gabe get skinner?

476
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,052
Either way, let's pee on it.

477
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,788
[Laughter]

478
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,725
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think we have a winner.

479
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:00,427
- Yes.
- Yes. Well done!

480
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,262
Whose is it?
Who wrote that?

481
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,932
Yeah.
Who wrote it?

482
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,002
Please. It was easy
once I decided

483
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,306
I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.

484
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:13,941
Where did he go, Holly?

485
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:15,475
I have no idea.

486
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:18,245
Do you see a little clown
that you wanna follow, huh?

487
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:20,113
Is there a little bird
that's chirping to you,

488
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,214
"this way, this way."

489
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,783
I don't know.

490
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,051
Okay. Close your eyes.

491
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:25,919
We need you to think.

492
00:18:25,987 --> 00:18:27,287
What is Michael seeing right now?

493
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,323
Can you tell him
that we miss him?

494
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,557
Michael, we're coming for you!

495
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,625
Will you stop?

496
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,160
There have been
a few coincidences...

497
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:34,161
That's all!

498
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:35,796
All right, then.

499
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:37,931
- Someone propose a plan.
- Okay.

500
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,434
- We fan out...
- Not you, Erin.

501
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,937
Stop looking at me like that.

502
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:45,906
Okay, look, let's just
go up somewhere high

503
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:48,175
and see if we could spot him
on the street below.

504
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:50,978
That is the stupidest idea
I've ever heard. No.

505
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:54,014
Tap into your common mind and
tell us what he would do next.

506
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:57,484
Look, I'm not playing.
I'm gonna go look for him.

507
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,254
- Good. We don't need her.
- Right.

508
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:03,690
I can do this on my own.
I can think like Michael.

509
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,026
All right...

510
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:08,395
I'm deep below the ocean's
surface in a submarine.

511
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:10,597
A torpedo's coming right at me.

512
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,700
No. Damn it, that's just
my own imagination.

513
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:16,603
Maybe he's bowling.

514
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:53,473
Michael?

515
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:57,010
Hi.

516
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:59,379
[Laughs]

517
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,982
How did you know I was up here?

518
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,483
What are you doing up here?

519
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:04,684
I got turned around.

520
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:06,386
I thought I could see
Dunder Mifflin.

521
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:08,055
Dunder Mifflin?

522
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:09,523
Yeah.
[Laughs]

523
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,160
Wow!

524
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,698
I just miss you so much.

525
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:25,138
I missed you too.

526
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,340
Really?

527
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:30,143
Yeah.

528
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:33,680
Can I kiss you?

529
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:36,283
- Yeah.
- Okay.

531
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:47,556
Maybe that's not the best one.
Keep reading.

532
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:49,176
- Yeah, it was.
- Maybe it wasn't.

533
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:53,424
Oh, thank God, I had a horrible nightmare
that I was stuck in America with Gabe.

534
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:55,894
[Laughs]

535
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:58,345
No, that's not the one I was thinking of.
Keep going.

536
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,702
I know what it smells like

537
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:01,085
but I didn't roll in anything,

538
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:03,990
It's from listening
to all of Gabe's bullshit.

539
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:07,920
Isn't this the perfect
romantic getaway, Erin?

540
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,836
Sitting on a desert island
in dog costumes?

541
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:13,162
I'm Gabe and... I'm a weirdo.

542
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:14,753
[Laughs]

543
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,203
Gabe's mom...

544
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:18,048
Mm, Gabe's mom?

545
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:20,875
Wait, tall woman?
Looks like Gabe?

546
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,591
Yeah, I banged her.

547
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:25,871
Yeah, there you go.
