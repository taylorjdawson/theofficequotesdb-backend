1
00:00:02,558 --> 00:00:04,131
Oh, a little help.

2
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:09,288
Wow, your hair is really thinning.

3
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:11,338
Standing as proven
to be healthier

4
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:14,549
increases productivity
and just looks cooler.

5
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:17,529
Picture someone doing
something heroic.

6
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,031
Now, was he sitting
or standing?

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,095
Not counting FDR.

8
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:24,957
Every second you sit there
is an hour off your life.

9
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,954
Look at all of you.

10
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:28,926
I feel like you're
in suicide cult.

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,701
No, no, no.
You're way off on that one.

12
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:33,366
Are you really comfortable
standing there?

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,532
I tried one of those,

14
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:36,828
and I just couldn't find
the sweet spot.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,677
Hey, guys,
let's just all admit it, okay?

16
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:44,038
Dwight's better than us.

17
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:46,125
He had the guts
to stop sitting,

18
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:49,357
and he's never, ever
gonna go back on it, right?

19
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,769
That's right, Jim.

20
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:02,172
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

21
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:03,614
Taking a load off, huh?

22
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:05,963
No. Putting a load on,
more like.

23
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,342
Good luck with that.

24
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:08,771
Last thing I need is luck.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,383
Thank you so much.

26
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:35,071
What are you up to?
Oh, look out.

27
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:37,027
- Just-- What are you doing?
- Too fast. Ha ha!

28
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:39,784
- Give that back. Come on.
- Prank!

29
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:41,978
Oh, that's real creative.

30
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:43,249
You know what, you're right.
It's not my best.

31
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:44,346
'Cause you could easily
just bend over

32
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,460
and pick that up, right?

33
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,567
I could, I just don't
feel like a loser.

34
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:48,824
- Because you're sitting?
- Standing.

35
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,356
- Okay.
- Don't!

36
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,925
- Because you're sitting?
- Standing.

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,525
You know I have to do this.

38
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,800
I know.

39
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:56,607
Whoaaa!

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,234
Andrew...Baines...Bernard.

42
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:24,975
I think you can just
do it with "Andy Bernard."

43
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:28,062
Andrew Baines Bernard.
I love filling these out

44
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:30,061
'cause it's like, oh,
I'm taking a test,

45
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:31,791
but I know the answers.

46
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,721
In four seconds,

47
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:36,155
my wife is going to be
coming through that door.

48
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:37,692
I told her she could work here.

49
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:40,514
Under <i>no</i> circumstances
can that be allowed to happen.

50
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,327
There you are.
Honey...

51
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,562
How on earth did you miss
the elevator?

52
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:47,477
What was that?

53
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,014
I don't know.
He wasn't talking to me.

54
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:51,893
But if I were you,
I wouldn't hire his wife.

55
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,716
That's why my foundation,
the Dream For A Wish Foundation,

56
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:57,043
is gonna put them
out of business.

57
00:02:57,124 --> 00:02:58,457
They're not gonna know
what hit 'em.

58
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,091
Everyone...

59
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:04,219
I'd like to introduce
my wife, Mrs. Robert California.

60
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,564
Mrs. California,
this is everyone.

61
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:07,985
- Hello.
- Hi.

62
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:09,661
- Welcome.
- Call me Susan, please.

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,762
Last night at dinner,
Susan and I were talking

64
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:14,597
about her returning to work.

65
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:18,536
So she's here today to see
if there's a good fit.

66
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:20,542
Something tells me
it just might work out.

67
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:25,115
This is Andy Bernard,
the regional manager.

68
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:26,654
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hey there.

69
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,685
It's a pleasure.
Welcome.

70
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:28,531
Thank you.

71
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:29,754
Andy, would you be so kind

72
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:31,869
as to show Susan
around the office,

73
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:33,632
introduce her
to various departments,

74
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:36,401
find a place
where she'll shine?

75
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:38,791
I would love to,
but I have to be

76
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,654
completely honest
with you guys.

77
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:43,062
We're 100% staffed up.

78
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,755
Andy, let's see if there's
a good fit first,

79
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,135
then we'll talk.

80
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:54,811
All right.

81
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:57,025
♪ Knock knock knock
knock knock knock ♪

82
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,499
You don't have to say it
if you're doing it.

83
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,499
Remember how you said

84
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,608
that you were looking
for a place in the office

85
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,622
to do calisthenics
and aerobics?

86
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:08,483
Uh, weight lifting, yeah.

87
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:09,845
Well, today's your lucky day.

88
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:11,945
I have opened,
in this very office building,

89
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:14,287
Dwight Schrute's gym
for muscles.

90
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:16,594
- Wanna take a look?
- I'll take a look.

91
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:20,670
Your path from obesity
begins right here.

92
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:25,349
I've been meaning
to join a gym...For my health.

93
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:27,325
I used to say I wanted
to live long enough

94
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:28,892
to see a black president.

95
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,517
I never realized
how easy that would be.

96
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:31,940
So now I want to live
long enough

97
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:34,586
to see a really,
really gay president

98
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,074
or a supermodel president.

99
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,679
I want to see all the different
kinds of presidents.

100
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,563
Obese people
in my office building

101
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:42,071
are a drain on resources.

102
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,564
Chairs wear out faster.

103
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,754
It takes more freon
to keep them cool.

104
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,256
They flush the toilets
more often.

105
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:49,811
Plus, their massive BMS
bust the rivets on my pipes.

106
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:55,603
But a gym turns fat into cash.

107
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:59,360
All right, the DM express
is pulling out.

108
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:00,919
All right, well, it's really
nice to meet you, Brian.

109
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,351
Uh, it's actually <i>Ryan.</i>

110
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,977
- Oh, Ryan.
- Yeah.

111
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,980
Bitch.

112
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:09,020
We will start here
at Erinville.

113
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,358
- Hi.
- Reception.

114
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:13,055
You're classic
one-man operation.

115
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:14,730
Although,
I was watching a movie,

116
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:16,615
and Meryl Streep had
two secretaries.

117
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,216
I was watching a movie,
and a bunch of apes

118
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,864
took over San Francisco.
Just sayin'.

119
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:24,406
Two secretaries could convey
a sense of importance

120
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,476
and success to our clients.

121
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:29,964
Certainly worth exploring.
Wouldn't you agree, Andy?

122
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:33,116
- I'll explore exploring it.
- Good.

123
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,135
Seems like you have this
under control,

124
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,313
so I'll just duck out
and run the company for a while.

125
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,114
Okay, next stop
on the tour, sales.

126
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:49,081
Here we go.
Station stop Jim Halpert.

127
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:50,722
Oh, boy, our resident
truth teller.

128
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,956
All right, have at it.
Let her rip.

129
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,386
What do you hate
about this place?

130
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:58,429
Well, it's sales,
so you have to be able

131
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:00,005
to live in the world
of rejection.

132
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:01,631
Maybe you do.

133
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:02,926
Hi, I'm Dwight.

134
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:06,906
Sales is really not
so hard, okay-- It's paper.

135
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,715
We have it,
and they want it so bad

136
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,417
they are willing to pay for it.

137
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,779
Jim?

138
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,849
Well, it's not that easy.

139
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,496
It's kind of sometimes
difficult.

140
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:17,692
It's the second-easiest job
in the world.

141
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,813
- Being a mom.
- I love shopping.

142
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,553
And sales is just
the other side of that.

143
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:23,777
That's true.

144
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,304
You know, if you joined
our sales department,

145
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:29,994
you would be working
very closely

146
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,247
with our department head,
Mr. Dwight Schrute.

147
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,180
That's me.

148
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:35,023
Dwight, why don't you
tell Susan

149
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,455
about some of your hobbies.

150
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,451
- Oh.
- Survival skills.

151
00:06:38,558 --> 00:06:40,359
- Mm-hmm.
- Ranking of animals.

152
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:44,278
Maybe over a beer after
she's closed her first sale.

153
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,515
Well, make that a red wine

154
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,879
and I'll tell you
<i>my</i> animal rankings.

155
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:55,347
How am I
supposed to pull this off?

156
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:57,425
The entire office is being
nicer to her

157
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:58,956
than they've ever been to me.

158
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,542
What I wouldn't give
for one of Phyllis'

159
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:02,977
classic room-clearing farts
right now.

160
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:04,870
Ready?

161
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,539
What do you think?
Huh?

162
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:13,384
Um, no, no.
This is not a gym.

163
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,192
This is like a scene
out of <i>Saw V.</i>

164
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,608
You haven't even
looked around yet.

165
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:20,266
Look..
Gravel bucket squat yoke.

166
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,682
Right?

167
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,202
Dedicated phone book
ripping station.

168
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:33,500
- You ever cut tin before?
- No.

169
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:36,728
Five yards in and your
forearms will be on fire.

170
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:39,070
Plus, I will buy the tin
back from you that you cut

171
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,401
for two cents a yard.

172
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,176
Now, let's go over membership.

173
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:46,163
I'm gonna need the first month's
and the last month's up front

174
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:47,516
for $49 a month.

175
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,340
But every third month
is $59 a month.

176
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,287
But the fourth month
is a discount month

177
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,375
at $19 per month.

178
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:56,887
Obviously, you know
how a gym works.

179
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,590
So you know I'm not
gonna pay money for this.

180
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,002
You want people
to come to your gym?

181
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:02,884
Make a real gym.

182
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,243
Darryl...

183
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:08,805
Make a real gym.

184
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,754
I was thinking accounting
might be a good fit

185
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:13,259
because I really clicked
with Oscar,

186
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:15,922
and I do have some experience
with bookkeeping.

187
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,394
But we already have
a surplus of accountants

188
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:19,532
as it is.

189
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:21,146
I would work
in customer service,

190
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:23,079
and, um, HR, even.

191
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:25,107
Those are fully staffed
as well.

192
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,941
Are you telling me
that there's no one

193
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:28,503
in this entire office

194
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,068
that could use
an extra pair of hands?

195
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:33,436
Yes.

196
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,784
I am the CEO, and I am telling

197
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,599
an employee of mine what to do.

198
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:41,971
Let me beat around
the bush for a second.

199
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:46,170
Our chairman of the board has
some very strong feelings--

200
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,201
- Robert, it's all right.

201
00:08:47,286 --> 00:08:48,965
This is very uncomfortable.

202
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:51,450
Obviously, there's
no place for me here,

203
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:53,060
so thank you for trying.

204
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:55,008
- Why don't we just let it go?
- No. Absolutely not.

205
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:57,871
Andrew, there must be
something you can do.

206
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:59,542
There must be.
Think.

207
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,016
Well, there are a lot
of considerations.

208
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:08,066
I would be eternally grateful.

209
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,820
It's not a bad thing
to have the CEO owe you one.

210
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,442
All right!
Well, then, welcome aboard.

211
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:27,868
So what happens next?

212
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,914
We get you over to HR

213
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:32,956
and then get you set up
with accounting.

214
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:35,242
Hang on.

215
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:38,795
- Hello?
- Say "hello, grandma."

216
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,581
Hi, gam gam.

217
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:42,199
Hold one finger up to Susan.

218
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:45,252
You'll just be a second.

219
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,703
You numbskull!

220
00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:48,088
You were given
a very simple task.

221
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:50,707
I could not have been
more clear with you.

222
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:52,326
Now say,
"are you taking your medicine?"

223
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,878
Are you taking your
med-meds?

224
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:57,848
Why can you not say
exactly what I tell you?

225
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:01,251
Undo this.
<i>Undo</i> it.

226
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,790
You didn't say good-bye
to your grandmother.

227
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:10,611
We promised we'd never
say good-bye.

228
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:16,900
Attention! I am now
accepting memberships

229
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:19,069
for the Dwight Schrute
gym for muscles.

230
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,171
First 20 members can
take advantage

231
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,423
of our "pay what you weigh"
promotion.

232
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,908
All I need is another gym.

233
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:26,576
As if I don't have
enough drama.

234
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:29,746
We have a gym at home.
It's called the bedroom.

235
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:30,797
Who's spotting who?

236
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,015
Don't use the bike
in the corner,

237
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,216
that's Bruce's.
Jeremy says--

238
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,851
Enough. Oscar, enough.

239
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:36,436
- Kelly?
- I have these sneakers,

240
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:40,774
which are basically just like
a gym for your feet, so...

241
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,609
That's okay.

242
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:44,428
I know how to build a business.

243
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:46,196
You gotta bet the black people
to do it

244
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,298
to get the white people
to do it.

245
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,667
Then you gotta get the black
people to stop doing it.

246
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,769
One step at a time.

247
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:54,705
Did you bring
your passport with you?

248
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,506
Who walks around
with their passport?

249
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,642
Well, I do.
Always ready for adventure.

250
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:01,712
- Have you had any?
- No.

251
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:07,801
Hey, guys.

252
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,671
So Robert doesn't want
his wife working here.

253
00:11:10,722 --> 00:11:13,690
So now that she is,
we have to drive her away.

254
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:15,792
Andy, if he didn't want
her working here,

255
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,828
then why did you hire her?

256
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:20,981
Oscar, it was a mistake.

257
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:25,235
But one that can be fixed
by all of us being mean to her.

258
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,405
How can we do that?
She's simply wonderful.

259
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,973
This is all pathetic.

260
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:32,676
I am not asking, I am ordering.

261
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,878
How mean are we talking about?

262
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,146
It would he great if
she were gone by lunch.

263
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:38,148
Erin, you're up.
Find her a place to work,

264
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,482
but not too comfortable.

265
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,319
Got it. I know exactly
which stapler to give her.

266
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,392
Here you go.

267
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:53,330
Um, do you think
it would be possible

268
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:54,548
to move to that desk
over there?

269
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,233
Because this seems
a bit cramped,

270
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:57,701
and I don't have a computer.

271
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:59,269
Well, that's a sales desk.

272
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:02,005
Yeah. You need to be
over here with us accountants.

273
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:04,675
Just sit here and be quiet.

274
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,178
And if you have a question,
just raise your hand.

275
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:10,530
But I'm gonna save you
some time, sweetie,

276
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,582
and give you the answer now.

277
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:16,403
I...Don't...Know.

278
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,389
No, I don't think
we should be trying

279
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:21,575
to make this place
seem unpleasant.

280
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:22,592
I think we should
let this place

281
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:24,227
just crush her spirit
by itself.

282
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:26,430
I mean, it knows
what it's doing.

283
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:27,714
That's Gerald.

284
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:30,417
Oh, wow. So cute.

285
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:33,536
Oh, that is so cute.

286
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:34,755
Aw...

287
00:12:34,806 --> 00:12:36,039
He's so tiny.
Is he in a ladle?

288
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:37,373
Yeah, he's in a ladle.

289
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:38,809
That's adorable.
How on earth

290
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:41,311
- did you get him in a ladle?
- He did it himself.

291
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,763
Is that ladle stainless or...

292
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:44,081
Oh, stainless.
Williams Sonoma.

293
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:46,616
Excuse me, waiter,
there's a dog in my soup.

294
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:48,785
It's not that kind of ladle.

295
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,821
- Very cute.
- Aw, let me see.

296
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,406
Ah, just the battery
on these things.

297
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,625
I'm sorry,
I've gotta recharge this.

298
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,612
I get it.
Last time I had a job,

299
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:01,231
I remember I hated
the boss' wife.

300
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:05,102
Of course, she was married
to Robert.

301
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:10,406
Your employees don't seem
to be taking to me.

302
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:12,926
Andy!

303
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:18,281
Andy, could you
step in here, please?

304
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:19,683
We'll fix this.

305
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,751
What is going on?

306
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:24,321
Please.

307
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:28,775
Andrew, my wife...
Has brought up an issue

308
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,828
that requires your attention.

309
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:36,783
So, uh, if you'll excuse me,
I should step out,

310
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:39,820
get to the ATM
before that homeless man

311
00:13:39,871 --> 00:13:42,038
sets up camp for the night.

312
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:49,663
Okey-dokey, artichokey.

313
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:53,717
- You hate it, don't you?
- Do you not want me here?

314
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,952
- Why would you say that?
- It's okay.

315
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,804
I understand.
I'm not sure how I would feel

316
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,890
about having the boss' wife
work for me either.

317
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:03,226
- It's not that...Exactly.
- But it is something.

318
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:06,696
Let's just say that
if you don't want to work here,

319
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,682
I am totally prepared
to respect that.

320
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,300
Why would you not
want me working here?

321
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,335
I don't know.

322
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,406
I think I understand
what you're going through.

323
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,211
My husband can be a very
difficult man to read, can't he?

324
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,747
Yes!

325
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,016
- The dude is an enigma.
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,018
So he is mixed up
in this, isn't he?

327
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:33,156
Got it.

328
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,359
What do you think you're doing?

329
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:37,894
Getting my sweat on.

330
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:40,397
I build you this temple
to the human body,

331
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:41,998
and you're lifting what,
five pounds?

332
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:44,401
I just did, like,
35 minutes on the treadmill.

333
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:45,535
I was watching you.

334
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,770
You want to know how long
it really was?

335
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:48,371
- No.
- Eight minutes!

336
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:50,607
Dude, I'm gonna be here
all week, right?

337
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,176
Five days a week.
I figure I'll start slow.

338
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:57,581
Is that the same philosophy
you apply to buffalo wings?

339
00:14:57,615 --> 00:15:00,867
I want you to bring that same
buffalo wing passion

340
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,385
to this gym!

341
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,121
I'm gonna make you look
like Lebron James!

342
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:07,190
It's Lejon Brames.

343
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:08,458
That's what I said.

344
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,076
You know, get it right.

345
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:11,077
I know.

346
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:13,630
- Cameras...
- Ooh, still here.

347
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,465
Terrific.

348
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,717
Andy and I had
a great conversation.

349
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:20,554
And I just want to let you know

350
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:26,426
that I am not going to be
working here.

351
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,544
- Well, that's a shame.
- It just was one of those thi--

352
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:31,581
Is it?
Because we talked about it,

353
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:33,750
and it seems like
that might be what you want.

354
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:35,652
- Which is fine.
- Where did this come from?

355
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,653
Did Andy say that?

356
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,887
No, he did not.

357
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:39,289
But I could tell
he was struggling

358
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:40,757
to understand what was
expected of him.

359
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,958
What's the struggle.

360
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:44,110
He made a great call,
hired a great person.

361
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:45,829
You sure about that?

362
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,781
- Absolutely.
- No games?

363
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:49,199
No games.

364
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:51,434
Because Andy seemed to think
there was some information

365
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:53,420
he was not able to share
with me.

366
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:54,737
Enough of this.
I mean, real-- Enough.

367
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,006
It's gotten way out of hand.

368
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,074
Andrew, this is my wife.

369
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:00,760
Whatever privacy
you were trying to protect

370
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,745
between us, I thank you for.

371
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,081
But it is not welcome
right now.

372
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,967
Just be honest.

373
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,721
- Andy...
- Yes.

374
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:13,089
Why do you keep looking
at my husband?

375
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:14,975
Andy, just answer the question.

376
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:17,661
- No games?
- No games.

377
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,663
Okay.

378
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:22,482
I mean, it was
kind of funny, actually.

379
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,467
Robert storms in, and he says,

380
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:25,819
"in four seconds,
my wife's gonna be in here.

381
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,137
"I told her
she could work here.

382
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:29,039
Under no circumstances
can that be allowed to happen."

383
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,840
You lying son of a bitch!

384
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:38,252
Tell my wife you're lying.

385
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:40,721
I am lying.
I am a compulsive liar.

386
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:43,857
- That's not true, is it?
- No, it's not.

387
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,260
I tell the truth
most of the time,

388
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:48,245
and I was just telling
the truth about your husband.

389
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,864
- Jim knows. He was there.
- This is preposterous.

390
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:53,617
- Robert...
- Let's get Jim in here.

391
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:56,370
Where's Jim?

392
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:59,106
He just rolled out
and crawled out.

393
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,641
Can you call security,

394
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,209
tell 'em to keep
an eye out for him?

395
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,145
Time to settle this.

396
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:07,315
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

397
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,449
I just need to get through.

398
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:10,818
Just real quick.
Real quick, open--

399
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:12,520
Okay.

400
00:17:16,091 --> 00:17:19,393
That's weird.

401
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:22,947
Well, he's gotta
be around here somewhere.

402
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:29,370
Oh--

403
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:34,742
Ow...Ow...Ow...

404
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:42,850
Creed, I was never here,
all right?

405
00:17:42,884 --> 00:17:46,604
Okay.
What about your friend?

406
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:48,456
Oh, boy.

407
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:53,894
This is my gym, my rules.

408
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:56,564
You do exactly as I say,
no questions asked.

409
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:58,149
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions,

410
00:17:58,183 --> 00:17:59,683
and I might not do
what you say.

411
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:02,853
First thing, we're gonna
stretch the pelvic bowl.

412
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:05,322
Ready?
Get down on the floor.

413
00:18:05,357 --> 00:18:07,274
Okay, I'm not doing that.

414
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:09,193
Really?

415
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,045
Too embarrassing for you?
Huh?

416
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,180
You wish that every exercise
was strutting around the gym

417
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:14,382
like the Fonz?

418
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,517
Well, how do you think
the Fonz got so cool?

419
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:20,204
He stretched his pelvic bowl.

420
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:22,690
I didn't know Darryl joined.

421
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:23,874
Looks that way.

422
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:26,677
Nice pelvic bowl.
Deep.

423
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:32,299
- Hello, Jim.
- No, no. No, no, no!

424
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:33,901
Don't.
Damn it, tuna!

425
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:37,521
So I think you know
what we want to know.

426
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:39,073
- Do I?
- Yes.

427
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:41,041
I know. I do.

428
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:44,345
Jim, I've had enough
of your unhelpfulness.

429
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:45,880
I really wish I could help.

430
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:47,481
I'm not really sure how I can.

431
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,533
For God's sake,
did Robert tell you

432
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:51,685
that he didn't want me
working here?

433
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:53,421
That's the thing.

434
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:55,122
See, I didn't want to get
in the middle of this.

435
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:56,390
Still don't.

436
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:58,058
But here's something.

437
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:01,562
I feel that maybe,
if we take a step back,

438
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:04,932
this is a simple case
of anxiety

439
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:06,250
to work with a spouse.

440
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,803
I think we've got ourselves
an answer.

441
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:10,971
- No...
- That makes complete sense, right?

442
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:12,256
Thank you all
for a wonderful day.

443
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:13,808
- Perfect!
- Jim...

444
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:15,376
- Yes?
- Answer the question, please.

445
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:20,247
I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

446
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:23,117
To be really honest,
my wife works here.

447
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:24,385
And I love it.

448
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,520
She literally makes me
work harder.

449
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,072
She makes me smarter.

450
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:30,324
She makes me remember
why I'm here.

451
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:33,427
And between us, she's
on maternity leave right now,

452
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:35,796
and I would love to leave
this room and see her face.

453
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:38,399
I would love it.
I don't know how this helps,

454
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:39,733
but it's just what
I'm thinking.

455
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:40,835
All right. Thanks.

456
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:43,037
Yes. All right.

457
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:51,479
- Uh...
- Yeah.

458
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:52,513
Yep.

459
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:59,887
Thank you.

460
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:10,948
Andy.

461
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:13,317
Hey, Mrs. California.

462
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:17,037
Hey. Uh, I'm sorry
about the position

463
00:20:17,072 --> 00:20:18,272
you were put in today.

464
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,439
You know, honestly,

465
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:21,709
we all wanted you
to work there.

466
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:23,460
Except for him.
Especially me.

467
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:26,130
Yes, I thought we really
hit it off.

468
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:27,464
Yeah.

469
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:29,884
Well, different circumstances.

470
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:30,885
Yeah.

471
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,219
- Who knows?
- Who knows?

472
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:34,722
Maybe after all this
settles down...

473
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,290
Totally.

474
00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:38,275
It's a date.

475
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:39,610
Hmm?

476
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:42,969
You're nothing!
You're so weak!

477
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,911
You call yourself a man?
Huh?

478
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:45,769
This doesn't help me.

479
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,235
I don't respond to
that kind of strategy.

480
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:47,910
Okay, fine.

481
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:49,245
Finish your set on your own,

482
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:51,373
and never come back
to my gym again!

483
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,980
Dwight, come back and spot me.

484
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:57,254
All right, I'll help you.

485
00:20:57,904 --> 00:21:00,551
But first, you gotta tell me
what your goal is.

486
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,783
- What do you want?
- To push this bar up.

487
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:04,377
No! Because if that
was the case,

488
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,738
the bar would be up by now.

489
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:08,187
- What is your goal?
- Help me!

490
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:12,624
- What do you want?!?!?!?!
- To look good for Val!

491
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,485
Val Kilmore? I don't buy it,
it doesn't make any sense.

492
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,258
Wow.

493
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:21,508
I figured out your goal.

494
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,676
I'm gonna make you the buffest guy
Val Kilmore has ever seen.
