1
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:06,311
Oh, for God's sake.

2
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:09,114
"Planking" is a very stupid
and dangerous trend.

3
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:11,483
Basically you lie like a plank
in weird places.

4
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:12,717
That's it.

5
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:14,519
Sometimes you get run over.

6
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:16,588
Welcome to the Internet.

7
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:18,606
Planking is
one of those things where,

8
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:21,593
hey, you either get it
or you don't.

9
00:00:21,627 --> 00:00:23,595
And I don't.

10
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,131
But I am so excited
to be a part of it.

11
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:31,036
- After you, my good sir.
- No, I insist.

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,288
The search committee
finally decided

13
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:35,273
after a lot of deliberation

14
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:38,426
on Robert California
for the manager position...

15
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:41,930
Who took one look around

16
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:43,348
and left.

17
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:46,351
He drove down to Florida
and convinced Jo

18
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:49,854
to make him CEO.

19
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,089
CEO...

20
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:53,224
Her own job.

21
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:54,659
He talked her out
of her own job

22
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:56,277
and I don't really know
how someone does that.

23
00:00:56,312 --> 00:01:00,799
But, anyway, then the position
was his to fill

24
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,317
and he chose...

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,141
It's unbelievable.

26
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:12,443
True, I might have been
the second choice,

27
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:14,829
but I was the first choice's
first choice.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,449
And, about Dwight,
I sense that he might

29
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:19,250
have some resentment
about not getting the job.

30
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:20,552
So I sat him down
and we had a talk.

31
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:22,821
And I told him, "I need
a really strong number two.

32
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:25,123
I want you
to be my enforcer."

33
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:28,343
Smart, right?
Very smart.

34
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,464
- This has got to stop.
- I can't get down.

35
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:36,017
Ke-- Kevin!

36
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:38,770
Yeah, at first
I was really disappointed.

37
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:42,373
But I've got a great daily
routine going right now.

38
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:44,676
I've upped my karate
to eight times a week.

39
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,361
I've added boxing,
lunches and on weekends.

40
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,829
I do kickboxing
three times a week,

41
00:01:47,863 --> 00:01:49,330
krav maga four times a week,

42
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:51,916
an hour of meditation
every morning at sunrise,

43
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:53,551
and again at sunset.

44
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:57,322
So yeah...
I'm doing great.

45
00:01:57,356 --> 00:01:58,756
Okay, I'm going to need
some help. Pam?

46
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,926
I don't think I should.

47
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,095
Oh, yeah, pregnant.

48
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,964
Right here.
Little Michael Scott.

49
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:08,433
Nope. I told you
I don't like that joke.

50
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,301
It is a boy--
We found out early.

51
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:12,837
Much different
the second time around.

52
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:14,806
And I have to say, it is nice

53
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,109
not being the only
pregnant woman in the office.

54
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:22,013
Look! It's, uh,
little pregs and big pregs.

55
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:23,398
Wait, when did we
start calling...

56
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,050
Isn't it amazing,
the difference in our sizes?

57
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:28,219
Well, I am a few months
ahead of you.

58
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:31,022
I'm having a child
with my husband the senator,

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,359
and Pam is having a child
with Jim...

60
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:35,960
The great salesman.

61
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:37,879
Hoist him aloft!

62
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:39,297
Come on, Darryl!

63
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,865
Lift, lift, Darryl.
Yeah, come on, man...

64
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:42,533
Yeah, I wanted the manager job,

65
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:46,905
but I got something
much better...

66
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,806
This soda.

67
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:51,226
This is mine.

68
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,095
It might be easier
if you take a deep breath,

69
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:56,931
lift from the knees,
and shove it up your butt.

70
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,852
I came up
with a new thing this summer.

71
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,254
I act like I'm telling someone
how to do something.

72
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:05,623
I go on with a long description

73
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:08,493
and then I say,
"and shove it up your butt!"

74
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:13,998
It's stupid,
but it's my thing now.

75
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,000
No one should be
planking at all.

76
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:18,903
Thank you. Yes.

77
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:20,672
Dwight, my enforcer,
my number two,

78
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:22,073
can you take care of this?

79
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,792
Say no more.

80
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,420
Kids, don't try planking.

81
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:38,890
It's dangerous.

82
00:03:38,924 --> 00:03:42,143
Especially with me around.

Are you watching
that commercial again?

87
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,561
Why do you keep watching it

88
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:18,396
if you know it's
just going to make you cry?

89
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,964
Because everything
makes me cry,

90
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,183
so what's the difference?

91
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:23,968
And this dog...

92
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:26,404
He just wants to protect
his bone.

93
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:28,472
He's got a bank vault,
that's a start.

94
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,507
Not enough, though.

95
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,676
All right.

96
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:38,249
The new CEO works
out of the conference room

97
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:39,350
about half the time.

98
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:40,918
But whenever he takes a break,

99
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:43,421
he does these weird walks
around the office.

100
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:45,823
And you never know
who he's going to zero in on

101
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:48,042
for these really intense
small talks.

102
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:51,012
You just hope it's not you.

103
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:52,664
And yet you hope it is you too.

104
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,866
It's strange.

105
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:02,607
Here we go.

106
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:04,742
- Hello.
- Robert California.

107
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:06,377
Let's have a conversation.

108
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,363
Describe your day so far.

109
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:10,114
Well, I woke up, and--

110
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,482
Erin, when you
recount your day,

111
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:13,951
never say you woke up,
it's a waste of your time.

112
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:15,286
That's how every day has begun

113
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:16,921
for everyone
since the dawn of man.

114
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:19,957
Very smart.
<i>Very</i> smart.

115
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:23,961
Suddenly...
I was awake.

116
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:26,130
And I have a new thing--
- Hey, Robert.

117
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:30,251
We have that 9:30 A.M.
casual chitchat scheduled.

118
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:32,136
I emailed you about it
last night to confirm.

119
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,921
And again this morning.

120
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:36,007
First item on the agenda--
Can I get everyone

121
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,975
an extra long
Columbus day weekend?

122
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,012
Item number two--
Connect with the guy.

123
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:43,481
Robert California--
What does he think of me?

124
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:46,317
Don't know.
Super care.

125
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:49,087
Number three, time permitting,
we lost our biggest client.

126
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:54,359
Uh, nope, I actually have that
on last month's order.

127
00:05:54,393 --> 00:05:58,112
Oh, sure. Yeah.

128
00:05:58,163 --> 00:06:01,999
Yeah on that.

129
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,418
Pam! Pam! Psst!

130
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:04,735
Pam!

131
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:09,757
Come here.

132
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,284
- Look...
- Jim!

133
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:32,280
Can I call you right back?

134
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:33,531
Thank you very much.

135
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:36,934
Okay.

136
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,705
What is this?

137
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,960
The Friday before
Columbus day-- Thoughts?

138
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:47,145
What are your thoughts?

139
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:49,614
Just making chitchat.

140
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:52,834
Kind of a medium year
for women's soccer, no?

141
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:55,303
See? I think that...

142
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:57,054
What are you looking at?

143
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,489
It's-- it's nothing.

144
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:01,459
- Can't be nothing.
- Yeah, it can't be nothing.

145
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:02,977
It's just a list of our names

146
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:04,846
split into two columns.
What?

147
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:07,231
Okay, just wait
one second, all right?

148
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:08,399
I will copy it.

149
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:09,700
Do you have a pen?

150
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:11,152
- No.
- No.

151
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:14,972
Okay. Um,
I'll take a photo of it.

152
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:16,157
Dwight, can you
throw me my phone?

153
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:21,696
Nice catch.

154
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,865
If he comes out, distract him.

155
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,000
We need a warning signal.

156
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:27,752
We don't need
a warning signal, Kevin.

157
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:29,086
I can see him right there.
We do!

158
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:31,205
- I promise you, we don't need--
- Warning! Warning!

159
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:33,341
Warning! Warning!

160
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,176
Phyllis!

161
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,213
- Oh.
- You okay?

162
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:40,932
Here, watch your neck.

163
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,216
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Oh!

164
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:44,869
Thanks, guys.

165
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,837
Wow.

166
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:49,840
Okay.

167
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:51,609
What side of the list am I on?

168
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:53,778
- Left.
- Yes!

169
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:56,080
Why are you--
How do you know--

170
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:00,184
Really great list
of names, guys.

171
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:01,853
Thank you so much.
Good work.

172
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:04,622
Uh, no. Actually, that was
in Robert's notebook.

173
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:06,724
He left it at reception
and we photocopied it.

174
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:09,660
O-oo-kay.

175
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,295
I don't want any part of this.

176
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,698
Maybe it's a list
of people he's going to fire.

177
00:08:13,732 --> 00:08:16,884
Okay, it's not that, Pam.

178
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,302
You know, I was thinking
it reminds me

179
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:20,104
of those lists
Dwight used to make.

180
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:22,039
This is if we were all
on a cruise ship

181
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:23,808
and had to divide
into lifeboats.

182
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:25,042
And this is if we were
on a cruise ship

183
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:27,211
and had to divide
into life rafts.

184
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,096
Here's something.

185
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:33,951
Who would eat who
in <i>alive</i> situation.

186
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:37,221
No. That can't be it.

187
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:39,457
I got to say,
kind of seems like

188
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,659
the left side's
the side to be on--

189
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:44,495
me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl.
No offense, Pam.

190
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,730
- No, I don't think so.
- Excuse me?

191
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:46,948
Shh! Pam, come on.

192
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,299
Don't be such a right-sider.

193
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:52,253
- Did you guys figure it out?
- We couldn't crack it.

194
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:55,072
Go in there and just ask
the man what it means.

195
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,643
He'll know that we looked
at his private notebook.

196
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:01,846
Come on, just say
you saw the list by accident.

197
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,348
I'm already working on this
Columbus day thing for you guys.

198
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:07,251
And it's starting to stack up--
feels like a lot.

199
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:08,519
One thing at a time.

200
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:10,221
That's all you had to do today,

201
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:13,024
is ask about Columbus day?

202
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:20,598
Yes-- for God's sake, Andy--
yes, come in.

203
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:22,900
What's up?

204
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,819
Weird thing...

205
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,170
Totally awkward...

206
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:29,273
But you left your notebook
on the reception desk...

207
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,741
Great. Thank you.

208
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:31,876
And--

209
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,547
It was open...
And people saw this,

210
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:38,716
and they're just kind of
going nuts, and like...

211
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,418
- What is this?
- Wondering what it is.

212
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:42,954
It's a photocopy
from your notebook.

213
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:45,306
You read my notebook,
and-- and photocopied it,

214
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,624
and distributed it.

215
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:49,126
No.

216
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:53,147
<i>They</i> did, and they asked me
to ask about it.

217
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,666
Please.

218
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:00,021
Here's what it is.
It's a doodle.

219
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:02,156
What?

220
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,775
Some people doodle at work
when they let their mind run.

221
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,244
They draw houses, penises...

222
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,281
Funny how the houses
are always colonials,

223
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:12,149
and the penises
are always circumcised,

224
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:13,884
don't you think?

225
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,203
Well, I doodle too.

226
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,990
But I'm not an artist,
so I draw words and lists.

227
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:23,177
That is fascinating.

228
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:25,496
And by the way,
I am so glad I asked.

229
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:28,099
People were just sort of--
Did you just move my name?

230
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,852
Might as well have been
sketching a cube.

231
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:40,085
Okay. Everybody think, quick.
What do these groups have in common?

232
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,003
Maybe we're supposed to do it
with people in our group.

233
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,455
That's not it.

234
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:45,691
- People in the other group?
- Mm-mm. Still wrong.

235
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:48,944
Stanley, you do puzzles
all day. What do we got?

236
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:51,496
Well, you take the first
letter from each name,

237
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,231
assign it a number,
add 'em all up,

238
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,467
and shove it up your butt!

239
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,869
- Thank you. A little
much-needed comic relief.

240
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:00,539
But we <i>really</i> need
to figure this out, guys.

241
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:04,309
I know!
It's alphabetical.

242
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:06,995
No.
No, it's not.

243
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:08,697
Here's how we find out.
Let's line up,

244
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:11,149
and compare the line, see if
we learn anything, okay?

245
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,485
Left-siders, over here.
Right-siders line up over here.

246
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,653
Face each other.

247
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,205
Match up
by height and relative weight.

248
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:20,709
Let's just size
each other up here,

249
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,096
and left side of the list...

250
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,997
Attack!
Wait, wait, wait.

251
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,499
Stop, stop, stop.

252
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,667
Will you stop?

253
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:32,270
Dwight! Dwight!
Go for it!

254
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,144
Stop, stop.
Warning! Warning! Warning!

255
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,450
I'd like to invite
the following people

256
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:47,953
to join me for lunch--

257
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:52,741
Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl,

258
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:58,580
Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.

259
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:01,049
That's great!

260
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,218
Let's do this, guys!

261
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:04,836
All right.

262
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,871
Well, I will see you in a bit.

263
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,140
I love you so much.

264
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:11,510
Hey, it's nothing, all right?

265
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:13,211
Text you when we get there

266
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:14,229
and let you know
what's going on.

267
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:17,215
- Okay.
- No. No dog video.

268
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:20,552
- Okay.
- Okay. See you guys.

269
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,490
Well, we should
all be really excited

270
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:30,128
about our...
Very own pizza party.

271
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,780
Pizza party!

272
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:33,165
♪ Pizza party ♪

273
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,783
♪ pizza party... ♪

274
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,334
Jim, your daughter Cecilia--

275
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,953
What does she think
of the street?

276
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:40,605
- Uh, the street?
- <i>Sesame Street.</i>

277
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,041
Oh! I didn't know
anybody... called--

278
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:44,342
She likes it a lot.

279
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,944
She, uh, loves elmo.

280
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:48,446
Elmo. God save us--
The Elmo era.

281
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,765
- Right?
- <i>Sesame Street</i> was created

282
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,851
to reflect the environment
of the children watching it.

283
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:55,353
The complete self-absorption
of Elmo

284
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,489
is brilliantly reflective
of our time.

285
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:00,659
Ours is a cultural ghetto.
Wouldn't you agree?

286
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:04,296
Yeah.
She does like elmo.

287
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,697
"Cultural ghetto"?

288
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,499
Totally, totally agree.

289
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:11,303
- Completely.
- Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.

290
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,371
The thing that I like
about elmo

291
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:15,874
is the tickling.

292
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:17,959
I should not be here.

293
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:20,378
I'm in the--
I was in the wrong--

294
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,681
I'm...I'm sorry.

295
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:24,516
Uh, just picture me back there.

296
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,218
I-I was never here.

297
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,225
- Great group! Pizza party!
- How is this a pizza party?

298
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,810
Well, why don't you ask me again
when the five pizzas get here?

299
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:36,928
Yeah, well that's just pizza.

300
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,029
You need at least
one other element

301
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,797
for it to be a party.
Okay.

302
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:41,066
You guys ever had
Margarita pizza?

303
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,134
- What's that?
- Fresh tomato,

304
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,321
with a dollop
of mozzarella cheese.

305
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:49,507
- That's pizza.
- That's regular pizza.

306
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,076
You know, I feel
comfortable enough now

307
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,193
to ask you this question.

308
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,980
What made you pick...
This group?

309
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:56,781
I just think you guys
are winners,

310
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,083
and I wanted to have lunch
with you.

311
00:13:58,117 --> 00:13:59,200
Okay.

312
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:00,818
Aww.

313
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:02,687
Well, what about
the other guys?

314
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:05,257
- Losers? Come on.
- Oh, come on.

315
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,758
- Come on, come on.
- No. Well...

316
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,510
I guess I think they're losers.

317
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:12,180
Ah, I knew it. Yes!

318
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:13,565
Probably shouldn't
have said that.

319
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,267
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

320
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:18,603
Aha-oo! Their interpretation
of Margarita pizza.

321
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:21,373
Fans of classic pizza
will be psyched.

322
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:24,526
Oh, text from Jim.

323
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,711
"This is getting very weird.

324
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:29,281
Will explain later."

325
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,718
Oh, text from Kevin.

326
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:36,371
"Suck it, losers."

327
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:43,187
Okay, now clearing the obvious,
but doesn't the fact

328
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:44,605
that I'm in this group

329
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,741
make anyone feel
just a little bit better?

330
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:50,110
Oh, this crust is sharp!

331
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:52,229
I used to be young and cute

332
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:55,216
and sort of funny, and...

333
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,485
I could do those cute,
little cartoons.

334
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,671
And everyone who came through
here was like...

335
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:03,140
"Who's that receptionist?
I like her."

336
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:06,961
Now I'm just a fat mom.
Yeah.

337
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:08,529
And you take one look at me

338
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:10,331
and you're like,
"oh, loser."

339
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:13,100
Come here, Pam.

340
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:15,269
Chins up, okay?

341
00:15:15,303 --> 00:15:17,938
Bad joke.

342
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:19,273
Look around this room.

343
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:21,542
Does this look
like a group of losers?

344
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:23,577
Seriously.

345
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,668
Oh. Oh, God.

346
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,038
Oh!

347
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,058
Hey, guys, we had so much fun.
We had Margarita pizza.

348
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:39,126
We all hung out and got
to know each other better.

349
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,177
How was your lunch?

350
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:42,196
- It was excellent.
- Good times.

351
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,098
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Oh, we did.

352
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:45,800
It was the best time.

353
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:46,967
And you know what?

354
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,303
Now it's over.
Back to work everyone.

355
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:51,722
You too, Andy.

356
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:52,890
I knew it.

357
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:54,775
I just knew, my whole life,

358
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,311
that everyone
was wrong about me--

359
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:59,179
my parents, my teachers,

360
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:01,515
my friends,
the doctors--

361
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,401
everyone.

362
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:04,485
Well, that was certainly

363
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,688
an odd lunch.

364
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:10,791
Is everything all right?

365
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:13,561
Yeah, I'm fine.

366
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,417
Just--
just take the--

367
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,668
take the casserole
out of the--

368
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:21,802
- Loser.
- Take it out

369
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:23,437
of the refrigerator
and put it in the oven.

370
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:24,889
Uh, it'll be fine.
Just leave it in

371
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,240
for 20 minutes.

372
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:28,275
- Loser.
- Losers.

373
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,910
When I was a salesman,
I could just be like,

374
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,545
"not my job, not my prob.

375
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,647
I'm going to the warehouse
to Polish my knob."

376
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:36,817
Metaphorically, of course.

377
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:39,286
But now...
It is my job,

378
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:41,055
and my prob.

379
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:43,774
Hi, Robert?

380
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,192
Can you come out here please?

381
00:16:45,227 --> 00:16:47,111
It's really important.

382
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:52,566
Just wanted to
clarify something.

383
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:56,804
Some people here
are under the misconception

384
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:01,292
that some people
may be considered,

385
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:03,243
uh, let's say top-tier,

386
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:05,179
and others would be...

387
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:07,381
Second-tier.
- I never said that.

388
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,583
Thank you. Great.

389
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:10,968
I said "winners"
and "losers."

390
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:12,286
Is that what
you're talking about?

391
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,322
Oh, that might--
that actually might be...

392
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,191
What I'm thinking of.

393
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:19,860
- Can you clarify that?
- Let me tell you some things

394
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:22,530
I find productive.

395
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:26,200
Positive reinforcement,

396
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:27,535
negative reinforcement,

397
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,936
honesty.

398
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:32,106
I'll tell you some things
I find unproductive.

399
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,376
Constantly worrying
about where you stand

400
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,945
based on inscrutable
social clues,

401
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:40,514
and then inevitably
reframing it all

402
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:42,950
in a reassuring way so that
you can get to sleep at night.

403
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:45,853
No, I do not believe
in that at all.

404
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,839
If I invited you to lunch,
I think you're a winner.

405
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,391
If I didn't, I don't.

406
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,226
But I just met you all.

407
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,628
Life is long.
Opinions change.

408
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:56,530
Winners, prove me right.

409
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:59,033
Losers, prove me wrong.

410
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:06,507
Whew!

411
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,742
Well, I guess that's that.

412
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:13,981
No.
No, no.

413
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,168
Andy, don't go in there!

414
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,587
I'm going in there.

415
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:26,794
I know that every time
I talk to you,

416
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:28,712
things just seem to get worse.

417
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:32,066
But, you don't know
these people and I do.

418
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,468
And if I let you work
with faulty information,

419
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:37,388
well then I'm not doing my job
as regional manager.

420
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,226
So...Please take this pen
and change your list.

421
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:44,378
I'm not going to change
my list, Andy,

422
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:46,347
and I don't use ballpoint pens.

423
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:48,582
Well, then

424
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:50,701
I will make a new list for you.

425
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,208
Stanley--

426
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:59,159
You may think
he's a lazy grump,

427
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:01,161
but did you know that he has
the most consistently high

428
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:03,330
sales numbers of anyone
in this office?

429
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,432
And you may think
he's hard to love,

430
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:06,867
but did you know
that he's in, not one,

431
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:09,253
but two long-term
romantic relationships?

432
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:12,590
I did not know
about the sales figures.

433
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:14,575
Meredith Palmer,
supplier relations--

434
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,645
The word "no,"
not even in her vocabulary.

435
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,080
And just to show you that
I'm being fair, you had Gabe

436
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,433
in the loser column.
I think that is...

437
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:25,569
Astute.
Good call.

438
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:30,324
Pam-- Easily
the most creative

439
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:32,960
and kind person
I have ever worked with.

440
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:34,245
Jim, shut the door.

441
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,463
This is just gross.
Shh!

442
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:39,767
Erin Hannon-- The receptionist
and my closest confidante--

443
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:42,102
a winner if there ever was one.

444
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:44,538
I like my new group.

445
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:47,975
I liked my old group.

446
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:51,078
- Are we done?
- Yes. No.

447
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:53,047
The Friday before Columbus day

448
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:54,882
we're going to take
a half-day

449
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,884
so that everyone can get a jump
on the long weekend.

450
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,720
You want a 3 1/2 day weekend
for Columbus day.

451
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:01,972
Yes, I do.

452
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:04,992
And you are aware
that Columbus and his legions

453
00:20:05,026 --> 00:20:07,461
committed genocide against
an entire civilization

454
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:09,063
of native Americans.

455
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:12,433
I don't care.

456
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:22,943
Hey, guys!

457
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:27,298
So Columbus day-- We got
that half-day on Friday.

458
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,116
We get that every year.

459
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:31,518
Well, you got it this year too.

460
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:36,056
- Good night, Andy.
- Good night.

461
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:38,392
Good-bye.

462
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:39,677
Good night, Andy.

463
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:47,334
- Good night.
- Good night.

464
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,650
All right, I'm going
to go warm up the car.

465
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:01,936
- Okay.
- Okay.

466
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,738
Oh, uh, you dropped something!

467
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:05,873
Jim!

468
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:09,944
Okay, I know I've been crying
easily today, but...

469
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:15,716
I mean, that's just
pretty killer, right?

470
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:18,646
I mean, maybe it's stupid.

471
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:23,665
No. It's wonderful.

472
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,323
I'm gonna frame it.

473
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:30,241
I can always unframe.
