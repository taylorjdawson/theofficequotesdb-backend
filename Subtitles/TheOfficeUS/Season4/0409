1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,189
Yeah, everything!
It's all good! Phyllis.

2
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:05,841
- Dancing babies!
- Dancing babies. I love it!

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,152
We are making a commercial
for Dunder Mifflin today.

4
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:10,697
Our first ad ever.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,073
Corporate purchased
some airtime in local markets

6
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:15,243
to spread the word
about Dunder Mifflin Infinity,

7
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:18,590
and they are even sending up
a professional ad company

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,779
to help us make it later, so...

9
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:23,209
it's not too shabby.

10
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:24,895
Best ad ever?

11
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:26,452
¶ Gimme a break ¶

12
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:28,047
¶ Gimme a break ¶

13
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:30,600
¶ Break me off a piece of that... ¶

14
00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:36,639
I am totally blanking.
What is the thing?

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,601
- Nobody tell him!
- What? No... Why?

16
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:41,102
You got it.
You're so close.

17
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:42,902
¶ Break me off a piece of that ¶

18
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:47,358
¶ Bre... apple sauce ¶

19
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,944
Break me off a piece
of that apple sauce. I don't think...

20
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,030
¶ piece of that chrysler car ¶

21
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,312
- Nope.
- ¶ football cream ¶

22
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:55,325
Okay.

23
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:57,047
Football cream.
It's football cream.

24
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:58,715
All right, so anybody else?

25
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,790
I'm taking a computer animation class,
so I could try to do a logo.

26
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,109
Look at that.

27
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,502
Even the receptionist is getting in
on the creativity.

28
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:06,669
Very good.

29
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:07,906
Hello, hello.

30
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:10,381
- How you doing?
- Michael Scott, regional manager.

31
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,884
- Nice to meet you. Us too, man.
- Excited to talk ideas.

32
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:15,272
You know what?
I want this to be cutting edge.

33
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:18,491
I want it to be fast,
quick cuts, you know?

34
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:22,060
Youthful,
sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.

35
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,694
- That sounds great.
- All right.

36
00:01:23,854 --> 00:01:25,355
This is what we have to work with.

37
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:27,762
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard.

38
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,899
The 'nard dog.
Who let the 'nard dog out?

39
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:34,322
He gives
the best back rubs in the office.

40
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:37,639
That's true. I give a mean back rub.
I also do good aromatherapy.

41
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:40,495
Not!
You just got 'nard dogged!

42
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:45,633
Now this gentleman right here
is the key to our...

43
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,460
- urban vibe.
- Urban?

44
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:51,973
I grew up in a small town.
What about me seems urban to you?

45
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,254
Stanley's hilarious.

46
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,695
Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth.

47
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:58,348
Kind of a less urban aunt Jemima.

48
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:01,645
These are our accountants.

49
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,376
And as you can see,

50
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:06,271
they are very different sizes.

51
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:08,148
What you might wanna do

52
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:12,498
is kind of a papa bear,
mama bear, baby bear thing.

53
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:14,829
- That might be kind of fun.
- Mama bear.

54
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:15,989
Who else?

55
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:18,514
I think it's great
that the company's making a commercial.

56
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:21,386
Because
not very many people have heard of us.

57
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:24,013
When I tell people
that I work at Dunder Mifflin,

58
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:26,014
they think that we sell mufflers,

59
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:29,877
or muffins, or mittens, or...

60
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:34,669
And frankly, all of those sound better
than paper, so I let it slide.

<i>Episode 4x05
"LOCAL AD"</i>

97
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,326
- You playing that game again?
- Second life is not a game.

98
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,131
It is a multi-user virtual environment.

99
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:22,555
It doesn't have points or scores.
It doesn't have winners or losers.

100
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,446
Oh, it has losers.

101
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,369
I signed up for Second Life
about a year ago.

102
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:30,980
Back then my life was so great
that I literally wanted a second one.

103
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,566
In my second life,
I was also a paper salesman,

104
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:35,777
and I was also named Dwight.

105
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,125
Absolutely everything was the same,

106
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,009
except I could fly.

107
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:41,824
Little girl

108
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,787
in a field holding a flower.
We zoom back

109
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:48,223
to find that she's in the desert,

110
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,916
and the field is an oasis.

111
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:52,609
We zoom back further.

112
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:57,757
The desert is a sandbox
in the world's largest resort hotel.

113
00:03:57,977 --> 00:04:00,093
Zoom back further.
The hotel

114
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:02,962
is actually the playground...

115
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:05,572
of the world's largest prison.

116
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,435
- Zoom back further...
- Okay. I can tell your time's valuable.

117
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:13,293
Actually I don't get paid
by the hour anymore, but thank you.

118
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,733
I get paid by the year, so...

119
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:17,360
That all sounds really ambitious.

120
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:18,531
Yeah, I know.

121
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,228
Why don't we show you
what we did with the national branch.

122
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:24,185
Okay.

123
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,138
That's what national came up with?

124
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,338
That sucks!

125
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,654
That's what we came up with.

126
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,114
We can do better than that.

127
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,522
The main part of the ad
must stay the same, actually.

128
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:08,265
Yeah, it's the last five seconds
where we've some leeway.

129
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:11,490
The waving?

130
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,326
Well no. You won't be waving.
That was just what they did.

131
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:17,045
You guys can be clapping, sitting.

132
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:19,146
Standing outside, inside, whatever.

133
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:21,883
I mean, this is where you really get
to be creative.

134
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:23,718
I need some advice.

135
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:26,679
Been spending a lot of time
making out with Angela lately.

136
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,203
We've been necking,
but only necking, right?

137
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,748
Not actually kissing...

138
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:35,605
our mouths.

139
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:37,245
Just a neck on neck.

140
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:41,319
It's just like rubbing/nuzzling
our necks together.

141
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:45,226
It's hot, I'm not gonna lie to you.
But it's a little weird.

142
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,592
But you seem like a guy with answers.

143
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:50,620
So how do I fast-track this,
get to first base?

144
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:53,387
We cannot talk about this,

145
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:55,532
because...

146
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,002
someone might hear us.

147
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:00,671
We'll use code names.

148
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,950
Angela can stay the same,

149
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:07,618
but we'll change Andy to Dwight.

150
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,807
That's not different enough.

151
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:13,434
Dwike?

152
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:19,023
You have a call from Eddie Murphy.

153
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:25,266
Hello?

154
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,793
<i>Shrek!
Shrek, I'm a donkey!</i>

155
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,767
<i>I'm a donkey, Shrek!</i>

156
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:31,967
I'm just kidding.

157
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,247
It's me.
Hello, Ry.

158
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:35,790
<i>- What?
- Okay,</i>

159
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,963
calm down.
I just have a small problem.

160
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,928
<i>I told you not to call
about small problems.</i>

161
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:43,201
Well when I call about big problems,
you don't like that either,

162
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,399
so make up your mind, kiddo.

163
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,050
Here is the deal.

164
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,639
The ad guys that you sent
are locking me in a creative box

165
00:06:51,808 --> 00:06:53,764
<i>and sort of ignoring my ideas.</i>

166
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:55,726
That's good.
They're creative, you're not.

167
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,264
I'm creative, Ryan.

168
00:06:58,424 --> 00:06:59,857
<i>It's not part of your job.</i>

169
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,399
<i>It's like, maybe you can cook,</i>

170
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,776
but that doesn't mean
you should start a restaurant.

171
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,447
Well, actually I can't cook,
and I'm starting a restaurant.

172
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,141
"Mike's Cereal Shack."

173
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:12,114
<i>I'm thinking we'll have as many
varieties as you can buy in the store.</i>

174
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:14,078
I'm not really interested
in that right now.

175
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:16,722
<i>I'm delegating creativity
to creative professionals.</i>

176
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,155
<i>It's a different skill set.</i>

177
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:20,501
<i>Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
But I'm good</i>

178
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:22,795
<i>- at managing people who do sales.
- Are you?</i>

179
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:25,469
I don't think you're doing
such a great job here,

180
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:28,025
suppressing ideas and creativity.

181
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:31,780
All right, let me ask you this.
Tell me if you think this is creative.

182
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,190
When I was five,

183
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:38,210
I imagined that there was such a thing
as a unicorn.

184
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:43,039
And this is before I had even
heard of one or seen one.

185
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,553
I just drew a picture of a horse

186
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:49,536
that could fly over rainbows

187
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,993
and had a huge spike in its head.

188
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,240
I was five.
Five years old.

189
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:57,991
Couldn't even talk yet.

190
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:02,093
Hey, guys.
You know what?

191
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:04,587
We cannot shoot this ad today.

192
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:10,384
- Okay, when should we come back?
- How about never hundred hours, sir?

193
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,157
- Wait, we were sent here to he...
- I'm not gonna argue with this guy.

194
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:16,015
Let's go.
Good luck, dude.

195
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:17,808
- Hey thanks. Thank you.
- Thank you.

196
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:19,592
<i>Michael, David Wallace.</i>

197
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:22,018
<i>What is this
about dismissing the ad people?</i>

198
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:23,463
Yeah, I'm glad you called.

199
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,908
Ryan is being a little bitch again.

200
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:28,828
<i>- I'm on, Michael.
- What's up, my brother?</i>

201
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,280
Listen, David.

202
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:35,472
I would like to do this ad in house.
I want to use only

203
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:38,845
the creativity
that we have right here in the office.

204
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,184
And I will send it to you
tomorrow morning. Take a look at it.

205
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:47,150
If you don't think it's ready to air,
send the ad agency back down here

206
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,507
and we'll do it on my dime.

207
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,051
<i>This is weird.</i>

208
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:55,315
I'm willing to stake
my entire reputation on it.

209
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:57,139
<i>Okay.</i>

210
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,933
<i>I'll see it tomorrow.</i>

211
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:00,643
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

212
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:03,110
And thus...

213
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,400
Michael Scott sealed his own destiny...

214
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,196
in a good way.

215
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:15,674
Has anyone ever come up to you and said,
"You're not creative."

216
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,384
Yes.

217
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:20,137
Well, they're wrong.
You are creative.

218
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,009
You are damn creative.

219
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,446
Each and every one of you.

220
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:25,684
You are so much more creative

221
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,938
than all of the other dry, boring morons
that you work with.

222
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,149
Who you talking to specifically?

223
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:35,571
I kind of know
what it's like to be in commercials.

224
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:39,583
My nickname in high school
used to be kool-aid man.

225
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,223
Younger, I always wanted
to be an actor in commercials,

226
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,205
then I realized I had a brain.

227
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:47,957
I'm excited about doing the ad,

228
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:52,494
but I'm not really used to doing videos
with so many people around.

229
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:55,374
We have three scenes to film,
big scenes.

230
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:57,619
We have a song to write,
so let's get cracking.

231
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,569
Kelly, I want you to do make-up.

232
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:03,263
Oscar, I would like you
to do costume design obviously.

233
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,873
I'd like you to look around town
and see if we have any celebrities

234
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,456
in our local area.

235
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:12,898
Sue Grafton is at the steamtown mall!
She's doing a book signing right now.

236
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,874
Phyllis, this is what I want you to do.

237
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:17,979
I want you to go down to the mall.
I want you to get in line.

238
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:20,864
I want you to get her
to be in this commercial.

239
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,738
This would be a huge coupe,
people, all right?

240
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:27,663
- Do not take no for an answer.
- Okay.

241
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,383
Does anyone actually know
what Sue Grafton looks like?

242
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:32,918
- I mean, is she hot or...
- She's crazy hot.

243
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:37,094
Well then maybe we should just use
Angela and say she's Sue Grafton.

244
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:39,466
- Would anyone notice?
- That's not happening.

245
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:42,161
I find the mystery genre disgusting.

246
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,263
I hate being titillated.

247
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:47,266
- Light it up!
- Get her, Phyl.

has created his own world.

And if we don't get this,
if we don't nail it,

321

325
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:16,833
Well,

326
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:19,519
I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book.

327
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,268
On my turn, I asked her
if she wanted to be in the ad,

328
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,525
and she said "No, thanks," but I wasn't
supposed to take "no" for an answer.

329
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:27,527
- That a girl.
- So I kept on asking,

330
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:30,948
and they finally threw me out
of the store in front of all my friends.

331
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:36,489
Did you or did you not get Sue Grafton?

332
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:39,706
No.

333
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:44,722
Can somebody give her a tissue, please?

334
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:50,634
Hope you're not killing yourself on it.
'Cause I'm sure it's good enough

335
00:14:50,794 --> 00:14:53,637
for Michael's ad
that will probably be seen by no one.

336
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,431
Maybe,
but it's not good enough for me yet.

337
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:58,809
Okay.
Do you want me to stay?

338
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:01,353
No, no, you can go home.
I'm good.

339
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:05,146
Pam is staying late tonight
to achieve her dreams.

340
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:07,199
So I'm pretty proud of her.

341
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:10,512
- Unfortunately, she was my ride home.
- You comin'?

342
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,139

343
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,350
Piss or get off the pot.

344
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:24,820
- Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
- Good morning.

345
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:32,453
Yeah, sorry. I looked away for a second,
and Creed snatched your hash browns.

346
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:34,663
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:15:34,962 --> 00:15:37,107
I worked until about 2:45 AM.

348
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,793
And then I had to decide
if I wanted to spend the night

349
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:42,276
with Michael editing in his office,

350
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:45,186
and Dwight
watching Michael edit in his office,

351
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:47,839
or drive home
and probably fall asleep at the wheel

352
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,386
and die in a fiery car wreck.

353
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:52,523
I passed out on my keyboard
trying to decide.

354
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:55,897
Let me pour you some bubbly,

355
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:59,146
because somebody got
to a whole new level last night.

356
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,341
Andy, I can't hear this right now.

357
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,900
No, no, this is good.

358
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:06,776
You know how we haven't gotten anywhere
that I want to get to physically yet?

359
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:09,615
Well, last night that changed.

360
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:11,339
We're making out.

361
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:14,914
I'm kissing her neck,
and her cheek, and her earlobe.

362
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:17,206
And she's not really kissing me back,

363
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,918
but she closes her eyes
and she's, like,

364
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:24,213
"Oh, D.
Oh, D."

365
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:28,779
She called you D?

366
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:30,274
Yeah.

367
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:32,248
D for Andy.

368
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:35,307
Oh, D.

369
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:37,439
Oh, D.

370
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:55,369
I'm about to send the ad to corporate.

371
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,292
And it is sent.

372
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:01,891
They'll probably watch it right away.
I would.

373
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:03,984
Okay.

374
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:11,044
<i>- Yes?
- Pam, please clear my phone lines.</i>

375
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:12,208
<i>Certainly.</i>

376
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:17,475
<i>Okay, clear.</i>

377
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:21,090
They could call any second now.

378
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,157
Oh, god.

379
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:35,011
I better call.

380
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:41,990
Well, it's been tough.

381
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:45,186
The geniuses at corporate
rejected my commercial.

382
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:47,795
And tonight
they are airing the brain-dead version.

383
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:49,907
So welcome one and all

384
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:53,419
to the world premiere
of corporate crapfest!

385
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:15,795
- Hey, seemed like a big hit.
- No, people are stupid.

386
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:18,197
People like waving.

387
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:20,378
Waving sells.
It's not art.

388
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:22,748
Yet we made our ad.

389
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:27,288
The real one was full of humor,
and full of depth,

390
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:28,629
and full of heart.

391
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,390
And it was real.

392
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:35,510
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Could you put that in the dvd player?

393
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,487
Hey, everybody. Just want
to welcome you all to the premiere

394
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:41,051
of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial.

395
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:43,608
The Michael Scott director's cut.

396
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,335
Hope you like it.

397
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,769
<i>It all starts with an idea.</i>

398
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:54,632
<i>But you can never tell
where an idea will end up.</i>

399
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:01,138
<i>Because ideas spread.</i>

400
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,687
<i>They change, grow.</i>

401
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:07,376
<i>They connect us with the world.</i>

402
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:14,675
<i>And in a fast moving world,</i>

403
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,173
<i>where good news
moves at the speed of time...</i>

404
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:29,543
<i>and bad news
isn't always what it seems.</i>

405
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:42,865
<i>Because when push comes to shove,</i>

406
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:51,490
<i>we all deserve a second chance...</i>

407
00:19:56,122 --> 00:19:57,300
<i>to score.</i>

408
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:05,962
<i>Dunder Mifflin.</i>

409
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:09,346
<i>Limitless paper in a paperless world.</i>

410
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,566
Really good.

411
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,380
Animation?
All her, by the way.

412
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,486
- Really? The animation was cool.
- Thanks.

413
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,247
You ever been on a motorcycle?

414
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:30,435
Michael, that was fun.

415
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:32,637
That was fun.

416
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:36,164
Next round of drinks is on me, people.

417
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:41,733
¶ Claude Van Damme ¶

418
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:45,972
¶ Hair for men ¶

419
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,758
¶ Poison gas ¶
¶ Nutrasweet ¶

420
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:51,172
It's gotta rhyme with "piece".

421
00:20:51,473 --> 00:20:52,710
Fancy feast!

422
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:55,557
¶ Break me off a piece
of that fancy feast ¶

423
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:57,609
It's a cat food.

424
00:20:57,838 --> 00:20:58,853
Nailed it.
