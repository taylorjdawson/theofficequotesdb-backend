1
00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:04,644
And the same thing goes for
quarterly reports. They're unreadable.

2
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:06,833
They're just numbers,
and boring, and black.

3
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:10,365
So what I was thinking is that maybe
we should have some sort of graphic.

4
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,801
Like if we have a bad quarter,
put in a storm cloud.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,790
And,

6
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:20,112
when we have a good quarter...
fireworks.

7
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:23,001
Or a race car.

8
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:25,916
Doesn't have to be a race car.

9
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:27,593
Use your imagination.

10
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:30,446
There's this cube on the screen,
and it bounces around all day.

11
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:34,201
And sometimes it looks like it's heading
right into the corner of the screen

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,387
and at the last minute
it hits the wall and bounces away.

13
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:41,101
We are all just dying to see it
go right into the corner.

14
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:46,691
Pam claims that she saw it one day when
she was alone in the conference room.

15
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:47,890
Okay...

16
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:50,017
I believe she thinks she saw it.

17
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:52,905
I saw it.
I saw it, and it was amazing.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,011
Who said I didn't see it?
Did Jim say that I didn't see it?

19
00:00:55,177 --> 00:00:56,330
I saw it!

20
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:59,278
We have a lot of colored paper here.

21
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:01,952
Why, oh, why,
do we keep printing this on white?

22
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:03,589
No!
Come on!

23
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:04,744
Yeah.

24
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:06,302
I know.

25
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:07,841
I know.
It's bland.

26
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,134
- It's never gonna happen.
- Dude, you've gotta believe.

27
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:13,721
Maybe
we could have some sort of riddle...

28
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:16,552
- Wait for it.
- Like something

29
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:18,562
that you have to look for...

30
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:20,901
<i>Sort of a Where's Waldo?</i>

31
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:27,621
All r-- All right.
Let's quit while we're ahead.

32
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:30,284
- That was so awesome.
- That was awesome.

33
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:31,421
Thank you.

34
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,957
Some days, I am just on fire.

35
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:36,997

72
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:12,414
Hey, there he is.

73
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,233
Hey, Meredith.
How you feeling?

74
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:15,993
I never thanked you for coming.

75
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,611
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.
Well, we all came, so...

76
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:20,888
Well, I real appreciate you coming.

77
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,898
I'm singling you out.

78
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:26,013
Anyway, I have this sharpie.

79
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,852
And I was wondering
if you could sign my cast.

80
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:38,222
- Can you write where I can read it?
- Yep.

81
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:46,258
I'll read this when I get home.

82
00:02:46,585 --> 00:02:47,622
All right.

83
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:53,555
Michael, this is the press release
I told you about.

84
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,292
Ryan wants you to share it.

85
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,454
Oh, does he?

86
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,458
He does.

87
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,914
Okay.

88
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:01,783
Attention, earthlings.

89
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:03,208
I have some news.

90
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:11,732
Today's the big day that I'm heading
to New York to attend a party

91
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,569
with sushi and important people.

92
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:16,906
On an unrelated note,
if anybody has an interesting anecdote

93
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,731
that is not boring and easy to memorize
please drop by my office before I leave.

94
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:21,870
Thank you.

95
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,801
Was that really
what Ryan wanted you to tell us?

96
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,294
And...

97
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:30,895
"Today the Dunder Mifflin Infinity
website officially launches."

98
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:34,371
Well, the website is the brainchild
of my brainchild, Ryan.

99
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,520
It is my brain grandchild.

100
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:38,957
And, to celebrate its birth,

101
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:42,061
all of the different branches
are going to have satellite parties

102
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:47,125
which will be connected via web cams
and fibers to the real party,

103
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,621
which is going on in New York City
at a very exclusive nightclub.

104
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:55,397
And that is where all of the VIPs,

105
00:03:55,563 --> 00:04:00,723
including yours truly, will be partying
with new york city's finest.

106
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,934
And I do not mean policemen.

107
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:05,344
"The company
is projecting record high sales

108
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:09,247
"and that by 6:00, the website will be
the new best salesman in the company."

109
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,469
Watch out, Dwight.

110
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:13,412
That's ridiculous.
I'm not gonna be beaten by a website.

111
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,806
- Actually, it sounds like you are.
- Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?

112
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:19,481
That's from Ryan?
Does it mention if he's seeing anybody?

113
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,043
No.
I'll find out tonight.

114
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:22,701
Yes, please let us know.

115
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,690
I can make more sales than a computer.

116
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:28,200
In fact, I challenge that website
to make more sales than me today.

117
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:30,724
- Waste of time.
- What's tha pipsqueak?

118
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,805
Waste of time.
The website's going to win.

119
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:37,024
- You believe a computer can beat me?
- I don't care, but yes.

120
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,467
- I'll prove you wrong.
- I don't care, and you won't.

121
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:41,916
- You'll see.
- I won't be watching, and I won't.

122
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:46,501
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.

123
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,450
It's very complicated.

124
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:52,965
It's caused a lot of unpleasantness
between Dwight and Angela.

125
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,774
Who were both already prone
to unpleasantness.

126
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,110
Stanley, you're dancing.

127
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:05,613
No, I'm not.

128
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,143
Yeah, I created a website.

129
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,080
Look. At the end of the day,
Apple's apple is flying at 30,000 feet.

130
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:16,847
This is a paper company.

131
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:20,009
And I don't want us to get lost
in the weeds or into a beauty contest.

132
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:22,246
I told you
I don't want you doing these things.

133
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:24,978
You can use your own office
or do it in the hall.

134
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:28,044
Convergence, viral marketing.
We're going guerilla.

135
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,314
We take it to the streets while keeping
an eye on the stree, Wall Street.

136
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,386
I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.
In other words, it is what it is.

137
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,075
Buying paper just became fun.

138
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:43,414
And this is
where I will record your sales.

139
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,247
Very nice.

140
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:48,327
And then will say something positive

141
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:50,923
like "kudos" or "job well done."

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,297
Or zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.

143
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:58,389
- I can't tell if he's mocking me.
- Just ignore him.

144
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,074
Can't do that.

145
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,205
It's really hard for me
to let things go.

146
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,634
I was.
Mocking.

147
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:06,445
Thank you.

148
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:11,318
I just feel like we need something more
to acknowledge when I make a sale.

149
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:14,798
- Yes, like a chime or a bell.
- Or a gong.

150
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:22,317
Go to my car.

151
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:23,893
Open the trunk.

152
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:25,890
Inside, you will see many pelts.

153
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,218
Under the smallest one is a case.

154
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:30,965
Inside that case is a bear horn.

155
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,114
Bring it to me.

156
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:33,430
Yes!

157
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:42,996
Isn't 7:00 P.M.
a little late for a lunch party?

158
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:45,489
Lunch party?

159
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,579
It's supposed to say launch party.

160
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:49,991
What is wrong with you?

161
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:54,491
Angela is worse than usual lately,
and we have a party to throw.

162
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,512
So I googled
"how to deal with difficult people,"

163
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,760
and I got all of this.

164
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:04,248
So we're gonna try out
some new things today.

165
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:07,927
How do you feel about the fact
that the banner says "lunch"?

166
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:09,357
I feel angry.

167
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:10,923
Angry at you.

168
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:13,338
Angry at you for doing something stupid.

169
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:16,165
Angry at me for believing
you could do something not stupid.

170
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,771
I'm so sorry to hear that.
That must be awful.

171
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:22,143
It is awful.

172
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,061
You've made this day awful.

173
00:07:24,372 --> 00:07:27,488
Maybe you could just change
the "u" into an "a".

174
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,892
Then it would say "lanch" party, Kevin.

175
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,166
Would it be better
if it said "lanch" party?

176
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:34,843
- Lunch party.
- It's supposed to say "launch."

177
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,631
Easy, booster seat.
Nobody cares about this party anyway.

178
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:39,626
I care!

179
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,359
Plan a party, Angela.
Oh, and the entire world will see it.

180
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,651
Oh! And here's $65 for your budget.

181
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:47,371
And here are 4 idiots
who'll do nothing but weigh you down.

182
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:49,326
Oh, and your cat's still dead.

183
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,679
- 20 seconds to go time.
- Got it.

184
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:52,879
Carb up.

185
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:55,439
Really?
Power gel?

186
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,171
Hey, you wanna win,
you gotta fuel like a winner.

187
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,642
Okay.

188
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:02,024
We start...

189
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:04,634
as soon as I make this shot.

190
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,610
What would you say if I told you
we could pull a prank on Dwight

191
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,639
and at the same time not be working?

192
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,467
What?

193
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,709
- He's going through a breakup.
- I'm aware of that.

194
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:25,206
But he's also being super-annoying,
and I'm not a perfect person.

195
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,580
- You got one!
- Three reams!

196
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,227
In your face, machines!

197
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,228
What kinda prank are you thinking?

198
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,184
What if I told you
I could offer free shipping?

199
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:40,892
Sure, I'll hold.

200
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,369
Who am I?

201
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:55,623
You tell me.

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,072
Not sure.

203
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:02,423
Just became self-aware.

204
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:04,805
So much to figure out.

205
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,937
I think I'm programmed to be your enemy.

206
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:13,113
I think it is my job to destroy you
when it comes to selling paper.

207
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:26,150
How do I know this isn't Jim?

208
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:34,517
What is a Jim?

209
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,291
It appears
that the website has become alive.

210
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,568
This happens to computers
and robots sometimes.

211
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,458
Am I scared of a stupid computer?

212
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,174
Please!
The computer should be scared of me.

213
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,450
I have been salesman of the month
for 13 out of the last 12 months.

214
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:50,994
You heard me right.

215
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,738
I did so well last february

216
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:56,267
that corporate gave me
two plaques in lieu of a pay raise.

217
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:05,677
Yes, it's too tight.

218
00:10:05,842 --> 00:10:06,876
Way too tight.

219
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,179
- Really?
- This is why I'm here?

220
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:10,516
Why is it so tight?

221
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:12,329
It's a european cut.

222
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:13,891
It just looks bad.

223
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,391
What's hanging?

224
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:23,156
- Setting up the web cam for the party.
- Oh, good. Okay, cool.

225
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:29,398
How many pounds
I could lose by 7:00?

226
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,453
Depends how much
you've eaten already today.

227
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:32,654
I had...

228
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:36,031
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

229
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,516
Just one second, we're in a meeting.
I'll see if he's available.

230
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:41,909
It's Jan.

231
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:45,575
Why don't you wanna go tonight?
What--

232
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,381
All your friends will be there.

233
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,527
<i>My friends?
Michael, I was terminated.</i>

234
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:50,649
Just.

235
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,032
<i>- Is it really that important to you?
- Yeah!</i>

236
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:54,488
<i>- All right.
- Thank you.</i>

237
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,840
<i>Go by yourself.</i>

238
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:57,578
No--
No.

239
00:10:57,743 --> 00:11:01,177
No. If I go by myself,
everybody'll think I'm a big loser.

240
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,800
<i>- Well...
-Do I've your permission to invite Carol?</i>

241
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:07,058
<i>- What? Jesus, Michael!
- I'm sor--</i>

242
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,299
I'm sorry.
It's just the first...

243
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:12,540
girl that popped into my head.
I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.

244
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,413
Nice!

245
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:17,260
Website check, please.

246
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,960
305.

247
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,821
3-0-5.

248
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:23,934
You, my friend, are winning handsomely.

249
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,798
Oh, it just made another sale--
380.

250
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:30,844
You, my friend,
are in a very close second.

251
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:33,798
- 402.
- Okay, why don't you just lay off?

252
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:36,142
What you want me to do, not announce it?
412.

253
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:42,980
So, this is the dealio.

254
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:45,587
God has smiled upon me

255
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:49,109
and given me two tickets
to the big party in New York tonight.

256
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,297
What are you doing this evening?

257
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,997
Look at that.

258
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,643
They have their own
little language now, like twins.

259
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:01,445
- Sure, we'll go.
- All right.

260
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,257
Fight it out amongst yourselves.
I was thinking Pammy,

261
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,119
but boys' night out is also good.

262
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,826
Oh, I'm sorry.
What?

263
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:12,938
- One of the tickets is for him.
- Just let me know who the winner is.

264
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,061
- Not it. I won.
- Not it. Nope.

265
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:19,259
Definitely not.
If anything, it was a tie.

266
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:21,220
Tie goes to the girlfriend.

267
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:26,306
No, I realize you normally reorder
in november, but what I'm suggesting--

268
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:28,035
You did what?

269
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,135
Oh! No! That's exactly
what you're not supposed to do, damn it!

270
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:33,759
Why would you reorder from a computer

271
00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:36,551
when you could have the personal touch
of a salesman?

272
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:40,002
- How's it going?
- Fine. Good.

273
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:41,187
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

274
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,316
- You look a little worried.
- I do not look worried.

275
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:50,736
You do look worried.

276
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:02,050
"Here's a suggestion, computer.
"I assume you read binary.

277
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:07,183
"So why don't you 011-11-011-011?"

278
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:13,017
Um, while you were typing that,
I searched every database in existence

279
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,815
and learned every fact
about everything...

280
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:17,235
And mastered the violin.

281
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:21,950
Oh, and sold more paper.

282
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,870
I asked for assort cutlery,
and I got back spoons.

283
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:37,211
These are worthless.

284
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:39,450
I want to understand what you're saying,

285
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:42,681
but it's difficult for me
when you use that tone.

286
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:48,471
Phyllis, these are spoons.

287
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:53,401
Spoons have round tops
and are used to scoop things.

288
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,033
What we need are forks

289
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,306
which have prongs
or tiny spears on top.

290
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:03,832
And we need knives which have blades.

291
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:06,205
Do you understand me now?

292
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:08,105
Yes.

293
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:09,819
Goody.

294
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:15,773
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

295
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,754
- What's going on?
- Paper delivery.

296
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,229
- Oh, yeah?
- Kelly ordered this online.

297
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:32,376
What are you doing?

298
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:35,612
I'm in the fight of my life against
this computer, and every sale counts.

299
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:37,833
But when you put
paper in the shopping cart,

300
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:40,675
it says, "Thanks for shopping
with Dunder Mifflin."

301
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:42,961
Damn it, Kelly, it knows!

302
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,791
It knows what you did!

303
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:46,951
- Who knows?
- Return it. Return it now.

304
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,048
Hey...

305
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,667
How about instead of yelling
at our sweet Miss Kapoor

306
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:54,232
over 500 sheets of paper,
you get back to your desk

307
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:56,504
and start selling multiple reams,
like a man.

308
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,261
You don't understand.

309
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:02,075
Okay,
if this makes the difference,

310
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,799
I'm gonna tell it
that you were responsible.

311
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:06,610
Who's "it"?

312
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:14,393
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

313
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:16,475
You still missing Ryan?

314
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:18,567
Not so much anymore.

315
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:25,317
I am not a bad person.

316
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,937
When I left Staples,
I took some of their leads with me,

317
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:30,003
but I never intended to use them.

318
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:31,902
What did intend to do with them?

319
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,121
Who knows?
Maybe keep them as a souvenir.

320
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,011
Maybe use them.

321
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:40,765
Yes, Mr. Galliatto, how would you like
to pay 10% less for paper

322
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,756
than you're paying right now?

323
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,462
It's not important
how I got your information.

324
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:48,337
What is important
is that you say yes.

325
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:50,163
- Good.
- All right.

326
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,352
I'm ready to go,
and I'm calling shotgun.

327
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,118
- I'm driving?
- Yes, thank you.

328
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,539
Let me just say good-bye to Pam.

329
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,317
Oh, yeah, you better.
You better say good-bye to Pam.

330
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:00,881
Say good-bye to Pam.

331
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,867
Good-Bye.

332
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,878
I love you.

333
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,569
I love you--
Okay.

334
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,630
I'm leaving inside Jim's car

335
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:14,635
I don't know when I'll be back again

336
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,599
Yes, I do

337
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:19,793
Tomorrow I'll be back

338
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,740
I'll be back tomorrow

339
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:24,813
So you know what? Why don't you guys
take off a little bit early tonight?

340
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:26,923
Because there's a party.

341
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:30,582
A party for the web site
I've been planning for two weeks.

342
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:35,091
If you are not this tall,
you may not ride the roller coaster.

343
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,788
- See you tomorrow.
- Perfect.

344
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,694
So let me just get
some basic information from you.

345
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:46,244
Oh. I didn't realize we could use the
leads we stole from Staples.

346
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:49,793
I'm sorry, so sorry.

347
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,326
Yes, could you repeat that?

348
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:57,866
Yes!
Ten reams for the U.S. district court!

349
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,029
Did I mention the 40 reams
for the battered women's shelter?

350
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:03,004
No!

351
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:09,485
Stop it!
Give me that!

352
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:10,740
Give it!

353
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,338
- Did you see the board?
- There's still an hour.

354
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:17,917
You ever read this?

355
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,233
Yep.

356
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:21,155
A long time ago, but I liked it.

357
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,651
I got it for Ryan.

358
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:26,107
I wanted to get him "Oh, the places
you'll go," but they were sold out.

359
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,915
It's the same sort of stuff in here.

360
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:30,685
It's not, but it's a good book.

361
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:35,252
What was that?

362
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:36,672
Leaving Pennsylvania.

363
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:39,486
Two kisses.

364
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:42,043
- One for me, one for Jan.
- Gotcha.

365
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,602
You should come for dinner.
You and Pam, that'd be fun.

366
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:46,716
- That would be fun.
- Wanna come over friday?

367
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:48,885
- I can't.
- After work, you guys--

368
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:50,674
Oh, no, because--

369
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:54,989
Let me know when we're close.

370
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:57,430
Yes.
Actually, I will tell you right now.

371
00:17:57,465 --> 00:18:01,475
It's a club called chat room,
and there's a password to get in.

372
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:03,622
Which is actually "password," so...

373
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:04,858
Okay.

374
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,194
What are you doing?

375
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,892
That is an invitation
to an online party.

376
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,648
No.
I'm sure that's not--

377
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:13,828
Are there...

378
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,756
three "Ws"
at the beginning of the address?

379
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:19,883
- Yes.
- Yep.

380
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,774
Well, the invitation says "VIPs only."

381
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,349
Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan?

382
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:30,217
We're already in the city.

383
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:32,740
The main part with the buildings.

384
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:35,454
What am I supposed to do?
What do you want me to do tonight?

385
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:39,896
And if you tell me that I have to drive
back to Scranton to the satellite party,

386
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:41,858
I am going to throw up.

387
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:44,775
Okay, I'm going to throw up.

388
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,225
I'm throwing up.
You're making me throw up, Ryan.

389
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:49,409
You know that is is like?
I will tell you.

390
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:51,901
This is like when the freshmen
would throw a party,

391
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,169
and wouldn't let any of the seniors go.

392
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,460
Doesn't it piss you off sometimes that
little twerp got the promotion over us?

393
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,628
Oh, actually I withdrew
from consideration.

394
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,287
Yeah, I withdrew too.

395
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:14,920
Four, three,

396
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,423
two, one!

397
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,622
Yes!

398
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,992
After numerous projections
that the computer would crush

399
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:25,643
all salesmen in its path,

400
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:28,262
I am very happy to report
that our very own

401
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:30,428
Dwight Schrute

402
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:34,610
has crushed
his electronic nemesis, if you will,

403
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,953
by a whopping 52...

404
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,101
- reams!
- Reams!

405
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:40,094
Say it again--
Announcing it.

406
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,455
- 52 reams!
- No, no, the first part.

407
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:45,290
Dwight has defeated the computer!

408
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:47,171
Hey.

409
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:48,850
So...

410
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,700
What do you think?

411
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:52,768
I did it for you.

412
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,720
I didn't ask you to do it for me.

413
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,221
You didn't have to.

414
00:19:58,154 --> 00:19:59,867
How do you tell someone it's over?

415
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,018
You send them a notarized letter, right?

416
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:04,686
Well, what if the recipient
is your notary?

417
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:09,704
- Hello, Pam.
- Hello.

418
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:13,353
Hey, do you have any men
that you can fix me up with?

419
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:16,041
I would like
to have a relationship with a man.

420
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,809
I'll get back to you.

421
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:21,084
Let me know.

422
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:34,026
You beat me.
You are the superior being.

423
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,601
All right, who wants to party?

424
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:41,484
- Why aren't you in New York?
- Oh-ho, what?!

425
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:43,449
Oh, I think I faked Oscar out.

426
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:45,971
You said you weren't coming back
and we could leave early.

427
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:47,719
I think I faked Stanley out too.

428
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,692
Who else thought that I was leaving,
and that he could go home early?

429
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:51,697
Gotcha,

430
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:53,381
gotcha, gotcha.

431
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:55,219
Well, who needs New York?

432
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,179
Right? We can have a killer party
right here in Scranton.

433
00:20:58,345 --> 00:20:59,259
Thank you.

434
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,419
No, no. It's gonna be nothing
like the party you've been planning.

435
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,220
This is going to be good.

436
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,265
And everybody's gonna come.

437
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,691
What's wrong with Dwight?

438
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,130
- He beat the computer.
- Oh, hey, good for you.

439
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:14,037
Good for you.
Scranton power!

440
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:18,478
You know what? Angela, I'd like you
to come into my office in ten minutes.

441
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,989
Bring something to write with,
and something to write on.

442
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,188
Good.

443
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:26,967
It was a pretty disappointing day.

444
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:29,777
It was kind of a slap in the face.

445
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:32,185
To realize that...

446
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:37,264
I wasn't as important as I thought I was
to a certain young executive...

447
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:39,162
Who I'd cared about.

448
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:42,070
But you know, I'm not gonna cry over it.

449
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:44,687
I did that in the car on the way home.

450
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:47,922
- How we doing on time?
- The party starts in an hour.

451
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:51,374
Good, these are some things
that I would like to have happen.

452
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:57,364
"Beer, light beer, streamers, orchids,
better lighting, something made of ice."

453
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,560
It's just things.
This is how I want it to feel.

454
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:02,259
"Pizza with mushrooms, pizza
without mushrooms, white pi-- "

455
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:04,447
I would like this party

456
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:07,900
to be sexier,
cooler, more important--

457
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:10,645
"Chocolates, someone famous,
cool music,

458
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,695
confetti, go-go dancers"?

459
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:15,374
I want it
to embarrass all other parties.

460
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:18,886
I want it to be a party
that the guys in New York

461
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:21,003
watch on the web cam and say,

462
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:23,776
"How did they get Al Roker to come?"

463
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:25,950
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

464
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:28,134
Yes, you can.
I know you can.

465
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:30,986
I wouldn't say that
if I didn't 100% believe it.

466
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:32,350
Who else could do this?

467
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:35,650
- Okay. Okay.
- No, seriously.

468
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:38,675
Anyone else who could do it better?
Because we don't have a lot of time.

469
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:42,914
I'll get the pizza.

470
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,637
What do you think of Angela?

471
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:56,121
I think she's efficient.

472
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,218
No, not like that.
As a woman.

473
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:02,347
W-O-M-A-N

474
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:03,888
I hadn't noticed.

475
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:06,469
You hadn't noticed she's a woman?

476
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,211
I hear she's single and ready to mingle.

477
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,680
I'm thinking
about making a play for her.

478
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,364
What do you think?
Crazy, right?

479
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:19,080
I think it's inappropriate
to date someone you work with.

480
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:21,406
- Isn't that part of the fun?
- No.

481
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:23,242
I think you should date Kelly.

482
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,876
She works here too.
How is that any different?

483
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:29,183
She works in the annex.

484
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,785
You're also welcome to date Toby.

485
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:35,172
Okay.

486
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:38,570
- Good news.
- We get to go home?

487
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:42,867
<i>Guess who just ordered
from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?</i>

488
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:44,588
Wait...

489
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,161
<i>Alfredo's pizza cafe...</i>

490
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:49,309
<i>Or pizza by Alfredo?</i>

491
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:51,316
- Same thing.
- No.

492
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:55,008
I don't understand
when you all talk at the same time!

493
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:57,347
Oscar, talk to him.

494
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,593
Michael, there's a very big difference
between these two pizza places.

495
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:04,660
Both in quality of ingredients
and in overall taste.

496
00:24:05,051 --> 00:24:06,767
Which one did you order from?

497
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:09,432
<i>Pizza by Alfredo.</i>

498
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:12,083
All right, you know what?
Okay, okay.

499
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:13,241
What is better,

500
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:15,580
a medium amount of good pizza,

501
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:18,360
or all you can eat
of pretty good pizza?

502
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:20,260
A medium amount of good pizza.

503
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,025
Oh, no, it's bad.

504
00:24:24,454 --> 00:24:27,322
It's real bad.

505
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,959
It's like eating
a hot circle of garbage.

506
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:36,134
You can pick one of these things.

507
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:39,127
It's unreasonable for you
to ask me to do all of this.

508
00:24:40,072 --> 00:24:43,703
It should take you no time if you put
the care into it that you normally do.

509
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,600
That seemed to shut her up.

510
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:57,499
You looking for dinner and a movie?
You're not gonna find it in that box.

511
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:02,413
It just so happens
I know where you can find it,

512
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:03,717
but again...

513
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:06,942
Not in the box.

514
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,579
Angela, are you hearing
words that I'm saying?

515
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:13,573
What?

516
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:14,949
Hello.

517
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:18,875
I worked on a party for 3 weeks
that just got thrown out the window.

518
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:20,974
So now I've to organize
a whole new party.

519
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:23,059
And my useless number two quit,

520
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:25,548
so now there's no one in charge
of orchids, chocolates,

521
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:26,888
or the thing that's made of ice.

522
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,510
And my upper back itched all day,
and I can't reach it.

523
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:32,437
And Kevin had
greek food for lunch again.

524
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,181
They say you should never mix
business with pleasure.

525
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:40,344
Really?

526
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:44,076
Well then explain to me
how a putt-putt golf company operates.

527
00:25:49,443 --> 00:25:52,115
<i>- Yep.
- The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.</i>

528
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,930
<i>- You don't have to say it like that.
- I said it normal.</i>

529
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:00,441
- Hey.
- Hey.

530
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,738
Uh, $63.50,
and that's not including tip.

531
00:26:02,903 --> 00:26:08,286
Right, I've a coupon, so half of $63.50,
and half the tip on $63.50...

532
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:11,426
Half-off coupons only apply
to orders of two pizzas.

533
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:13,978
No, I told them on phone
I was ordering eight pizzas.

534
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,290
I don't care what you told them
on the phone. That's our policy.

535
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:20,444
You didn't think that I was gonna
spend 60 bucks on pizza?

536
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:21,665
It's not pizza.

537
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,634
It doesn't say it
anywhere on the coupon,

538
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,225
and if it's your policy,
it should say it on the coupon.

539
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:30,283
What do you mean?

540
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,813
- Not my problem.
- It is your problem.

541
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:36,356
That's no way to do business, okay?

542
00:26:36,524 --> 00:26:40,071
I ordered
eight pizzas with a half-off coupon,

543
00:26:40,236 --> 00:26:43,300
so I would like eight pizzas
for half off, end of story.

544
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:45,175
Great story.

545
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:48,792
- $63.50, and that's not including tip.
- I'm not giving that to you.

546
00:26:49,118 --> 00:26:50,862
Then, you're not getting your pizzas.

547
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:52,571
No, no, you're not--

548
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:55,156
You are not going anywhere.

549
00:26:55,378 --> 00:26:58,094
You're going to stay here
until we figure this out.

550
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,904
- What?
- You know what?

551
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:04,340
This young man needs to learn
that that's not how you treat people.

552
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:06,657
I don't care if it's pizza.

553
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:09,899
Good business is
about respect and accountability

554
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,815
and follow-through.
You don't just make promises

555
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,979
and pull the rug out
from under somebody, do you?

556
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:18,935
Dwight, please escort this young man
into the conference room.

557
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:20,030
Right now. Get him
in the conference room.

558
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,670
- I'm not going in there.
- Yeah, you are.

559
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:24,437
And you'll come out when you decide
to give me a discount on the pizza.

560
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,850
Please.
Thank you.

561
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:27,775
This is stupid.

562
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,845
No, you don't even know what stupid is!

563
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:34,731
It's about to get all stupid up in here!

564
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:49,323
You find anything?

565
00:27:49,925 --> 00:27:52,539
We think
it's a straight forward kidnapping.

566
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:54,612
Stanley,
could you look up "accomplices?"

567
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:56,126
Why can't you guys do it?

568
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,228
Because we're looking up "jail time."

569
00:27:58,657 --> 00:27:59,691
Fine.

570
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:04,000
I've seen this kid, he sneaks
onto my farm and steals my hemp.

571
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,397
Yeah, I know that guy.

572
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:07,798
He's that farmer
that grows really crappy weed.

573
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:18,537
- You ready to give me my discount now?
- No.

574
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:21,295
What have you done in here
this whole time?

575
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,717
- What kind of business is this?
- A paper company.

576
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,942
The best paper company
in the whole wide world!

577
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:27,586
Dwight, knock it off.

578
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,901
You'd better think
about what you're doing.

579
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,471
You'd better think
about what you're doing.

580
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:33,572
No.

581
00:28:33,737 --> 00:28:37,288
I'm an adult.
I don't have to think or do anything.

582
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:40,480
You're a kid.
You're a little snot-nose punk kid

583
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:42,479
who thinks he's better
than everybody else.

584
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,229
Because he's some hotshot.

585
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:46,593
And you don't know anything about sales.

586
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,986
So stop being
a disrespectful little jerk, okay?

587
00:28:49,151 --> 00:28:51,348
- Sales?
- Yeah, sales. You sell pizza.

588
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:53,620
- That's called sales.
- You're such a loser.

589
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:55,524
- What did you call him?
- A loser.

590
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,560
- What did you say?!
- A loser.

591
00:28:57,989 --> 00:28:59,307
Okay, stop it.
Stop it!

592
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:01,102
Stop getting him to say it!

593
00:29:01,592 --> 00:29:04,454
- You just made this worse. A lot worse.
- I can make him talk.

594
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:06,912
We are accomplices.

595
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,848
Stop talking all at once!

596
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:12,142
- You need to let him go.
- Let go of little jerk boy?

597
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,822
Before he has learned his lesson?

598
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,506
- Yes.
- You know what, Jim?

599
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:19,506
World would be a better place if people
were held accountable for their actions.

600
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,284
Yes, but not by kidnapping them.

601
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,795
I'm not kidnapping him.
I'm keeping him until I get what I want.

602
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:26,169
As a hostage.

603
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,665
- You over-think it.
- You under-think it.

604
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,338
Yes, is Alfredo there?

605
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:33,396
May I speak to manager then?

606
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,243
Okay, could you tell the manager
that I am keeping his delivery kid

607
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,254
until I get my discount
on the eight pizzas I ordered?

608
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,703
Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.

609
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:47,548
Also, I would like him to throw in...

610
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:51,055
two--
three pizzas

611
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:52,872
just for our...

612
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:54,354
- Ransom.
- trouble.

613
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:57,157
Okay.

614
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,754
All right.

615
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,118
- What'd he say?
- He said no.

616
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,567
- So we should let him go.
- No, no.

617
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:07,324
Listen up, kid.

618
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,431
I don't like you,

619
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:14,692
but because some town in Switzerland
says so, you have rights.

620
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,383
I have to hang these.

621
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,237
Why are you looking at her like that?

622
00:30:31,402 --> 00:30:32,450
Hey!

623
00:30:43,562 --> 00:30:44,692
What's going on?

624
00:30:44,857 --> 00:30:46,823
Michael called the pizza place
with demands.

625
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:48,632
Mr. Overdramatic.
What's up, Kev?

626
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:50,665
We're getting hungry out there.

627
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:55,863
We're all accomplices now anyway,
so we figured we might as well eat.

628
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:01,592
<i>We would like to order some good pizza
from Alfredo's pizza cafe</i>

629
00:31:02,014 --> 00:31:05,828
while we wait for the hostage situation
with the bad pizza to end.

630
00:31:09,274 --> 00:31:10,597
I needed another hour.

631
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,632
It could have been done in another hour.

632
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:14,190
I think it looks good.

633
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,359
That's why
you're not in charge, Meredith.

634
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:25,252
Here you are, my dear.
One thing made of ice.

635
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,909
How did you...

636
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:31,760
Where--
Where did you...

637
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:34,639
It's just ice.
It'll melt all over the floor.

638
00:31:34,824 --> 00:31:37,086
- Will you help me put it over there?
- Yes, I will.

639
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:38,904
Excuse me.

640
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:41,149
I stole it.

641
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:46,383
Thank god.

642
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:50,619
Ryan wants to introduce
the branch managers in a few minutes.

643
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,740
You just have to wave
and introduce yourself.

644
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:54,545
I'll just wave and introduce myself.

645
00:31:56,162 --> 00:31:57,696
- Quick question.
- Yeah.

646
00:31:57,861 --> 00:31:59,387
If I take a pizza,

647
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,045
do you think you could take some sodas
and some napkins up to the roof?

648
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,523
- I'm all over it.
- Okay.

649
00:32:06,443 --> 00:32:07,737
What do we got here?

650
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,953
- Good pizza.
- Yeah?

651
00:32:10,118 --> 00:32:13,005
- Cheese, or do we have other flavors?
- Different stuff.

652
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:14,723
Which one's this?
Perfect.

653
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:20,442
Do you remember what you said to me
on my first day at work,

654
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,400
just before
you walked me over to my desk?

655
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:27,489
"Enjoy this moment, because you're never
going to go back to this time

656
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,326
"before you met your desk-mate Dwight."

657
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:31,901
And that's when I knew.

658
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:33,559
You?

659
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:35,870
You came up to my desk and you said,

660
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:37,600
"This might sound weird,

661
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:40,742
"and there's no reason for me
to know this,

662
00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:43,832
"but that mixed berry yogurt
you're about to eat has expired."

663
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:46,305
That was the moment
that you knew you liked me?

664
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:47,299
Yep.

665
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:53,175
- Can we make it a different moment?
- Nope.

666
00:32:55,318 --> 00:32:56,770
Can I start talking?

667
00:32:57,995 --> 00:33:01,314
<i>Is this thing on? Give me a signal
when you want me to start.</i>

668
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:07,602
<i>And now, from my old hometown,
Scranton, Pennsylvania,</i>

669
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:10,429
<i>my former boss,
Michael Scott.</i>

670
00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:12,483
I just think you should know

671
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:15,521
that one of my salesmen
beat your stupid computer.

672
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,261
So take that, asshole.

673
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,290
<i>Always a jokester.</i>

674
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,556
<i>How about that image?
Crystal clear.</i>

675
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:31,416
If anyone out there is listening,
I'm being held here against my will.

676
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:32,984
I'm a minor.

677
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:39,091
What are you doing?

678
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,153
You said your upper back itched.

679
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:43,340
- I didn't ask you to scratch it.
- Angela,

680
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,454
I know this is weird
because we work together,

681
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:49,323
and because up until and possibly
including now, I've repulsed you.

682
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,372
- But I like you.
- I'm not dating you.

683
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,116
So Angela is stubborn as a mule.

684
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:03,984
She's giving off fairly strong vibes
that she's not interested.

685
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:09,675
But do I like her or not?

686
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:12,278
Because if I like her,

687
00:34:13,187 --> 00:34:15,272
then I can't back down.

688
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:20,386
If you're going number one,
you've got ten more seconds!

689
00:34:23,248 --> 00:34:24,457
Hey, have you seen Jim?

690
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:27,142
I guess he wanted get out of here
before the cops find out.

691
00:34:32,312 --> 00:34:33,529
What are you doing?

692
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:36,924
Scaring him. The trick is to make him
think you're gonna do something to him.

693
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:39,808
- I can hear you, man.
- Shut up! Or I punch you in the throat!

694
00:34:40,022 --> 00:34:41,306
Stop it!
Stop it!

695
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:43,929
No. God.
Oh, my god.

696
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,253
Oh, my god.

697
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:51,189
I kidnapped a kid.

698
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:53,676
You had to.
What other choice did you have?

699
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,543
I've gotta pay for the pizza.

700
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:57,325
Well...

701
00:34:58,272 --> 00:34:59,208
Yeah.

702
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,761
Oh, my god.

703
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:09,340
<i>- This is Michael.
- Hello, Michael, this is Ryan.</i>

704
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:12,784
<i>- First off, thanks for the shout-out.
- You're breaking up. I can't hear you.</i>

705
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:16,883
<i>Why's there a kid on your web cam saying
that he's being held against his...</i>

706
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:22,612
I want you to go in there

707
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:26,877
and pay him for the pizzas,
and give him a generous tip.

708
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:28,948
No more than 10%.

709
00:35:29,215 --> 00:35:31,298
- What will you do?
- I...

710
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,235
will open the door.

711
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,622
- Yeah?
- And hopefully,

712
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,463
he will walk out.

713
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,770
And the rest is out of our hands.

714
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:45,631
So I'm paying full price?

715
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:46,777
Yes.

716
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,048
Here we go.

717
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:50,530
$65.

718
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:52,110
You know what?

719
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,894
Here's two more.

720
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,796
See ya.
Drive safely.

721
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:04,686
Okay.

722
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:06,614
Now what?

723
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:10,058
Now we wait
and hope that nothing happens.

724
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:12,014
All right.

725
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:13,917
I assume I'm going to be reimbursed?

726
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,151
Not now, Dwight, please.
Not the time.

727
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:19,721
A toast.

728
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:22,301
Better make it good.

729
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:25,857
To avoiding a class 2 felony charge.

730
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:34,095
Hello?

731
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,857
Hey.
Hang on a second.

732
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:44,899
Hello?
Hang on.

733
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:59,484
If you change your mind

734
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:01,820
I'll be first in line

735
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:04,119
Honey, I'm still free

736
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:06,006
Take a chance on me

737
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,003
If you need me let me know
Gonna be around

738
00:37:11,246 --> 00:37:15,587
If you got no place to go
If you're feeling down

739
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:17,837
If you're all alone

740
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:20,565
When the pretty birds have flown

741
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:22,438
Honey, I'm still free

742
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:24,862
Take a chance on me

743
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:27,598
Gonna do my very best

744
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:29,654
And that ain't no lie

745
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:32,231
If you put me to the test

746
00:37:32,396 --> 00:37:34,045
If you let me try

747
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:38,674
Take a chance on me

748
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:40,818
That's all I ask of you, Angela.

749
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,930
<i>- Hey, how'd it go?
- Yeah, what'd she say?</i>

750
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:11,169
I don't know yet.

751
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:12,902
I've to call you back.

752
00:38:13,068 --> 00:38:15,087
<i>- You gotta give us--
- I'll call you back!</i>

753
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:19,522
I have to go clean up after the party.

754
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:39,479
What a horrible day.

755
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:48,322
Well, I need to get the horrible taste
of this pizza out of my mouth.

756
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:51,486
I'd really like some sushi.

757
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:55,034
I was hoping that I would have
New York-style sushi today.

758
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,590
And you know what?

759
00:38:57,244 --> 00:38:58,910
- What?
- I'm gonna get it.

760
00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:01,273
Cooper says calamari.

761
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:04,983
There's only one place
to get New York-style sushi.

762
00:39:05,149 --> 00:39:06,425
- Tokyo?
- New York.

763
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,412
You wanna go?

764
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:10,032
- Yes!
- All right, you drive.

765
00:39:10,197 --> 00:39:11,232
Okay!

766
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:13,190
- Nice!
- Here we go.

767
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:19,382
I'm sorry--
You guys are gonna have to leave.

768
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:22,008
Hey, you know what?

769
00:39:25,786 --> 00:39:27,409
Come on. Come on.
Let's go!

770
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,602
Hey, you're the Scranton guy.

771
00:39:38,505 --> 00:39:40,656
- Guilty.
- I liked your statement tonight.

772
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:42,880
Okay.
Thanks.

773
00:39:44,368 --> 00:39:46,720
This is the guy that beat the computer.

774
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:49,953
Oh, very cool. It was funny
to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.

775
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:52,036
Yeah.

776
00:39:52,317 --> 00:39:53,448
See you later.

777
00:39:54,577 --> 00:39:55,611
Later on.

778
00:39:57,451 --> 00:39:59,297
I'm Ryan, and...

779
00:39:59,674 --> 00:40:02,425
tonight didn't go the way
that I thought it would.

780
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:05,234
Because...
it didn't work out for me.

781
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:07,088
I'm very embarrassed.

782
00:40:07,431 --> 00:40:08,817
I have egg all over my face.

783
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:10,486
And...
I'm 12 years old.

784
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:13,662
I spent so much time in Scranton,
but I never sold any paper.

785
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,464
I never sold any paper,
because I'm an idiot.

786
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,579
I started a fire with my cheese peeler.

787
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:21,335
And dated an indian girl.

788
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:23,964
I started a fire.

789
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:25,689
Now I got a beard.

790
00:40:25,897 --> 00:40:28,319
And I have new shoes
and I'm your boss.

791
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:30,500
I'm hot.
I'm so hot.

792
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:34,013
- That-- That's why everybody--
- I don't get-- I don't understand that.

793
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:36,086
That's part of it.
It's just...

794
00:40:53,657 --> 00:40:54,900
Wanna head back?

795
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:57,494
Yeah, let's go.
