1
00:00:02,338 --> 00:00:04,068
- Hey, I got you one.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:07,083
Thank you. I was gonna grab
some chips, you want some?

3
00:00:07,243 --> 00:00:09,968
No, thanks.
We're still having lunch today, right?

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,265
I guess.

5
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:16,708
How dare you?

6
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:31,942
Hey, Toby?

7
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:33,502
What's this?

8
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:37,555
I just wanna remind everyone
about the company rules involving PDA,

9
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:40,168
- or public displays of affection.
- Yes...

10
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,156
Some people in the office
have complained.

11
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:45,564
- Oh, really.
- About other people engaging in PDA.

12
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:48,717
And you know, just wanted to remind them
it's not appropriate to do that.

13
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:51,012
Is this about me and Jan in my office?

14
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:53,301
Because I'll have you know that
that was consensual.

15
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:56,563
What we did has nothing to do
with you or anyone here.

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,853
I don't think anyone heard anything.

17
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:00,557
We're very discreet.

18
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:03,312
And most people had left by that point.

19
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:05,525
So I don't think
it's any of your business.

20
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:08,781
What I think you should do,
is roll up the memo real tight...

21
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:11,449
Okay, look, the memo was not out you.

22
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,138
For the record, I've never been involved
with anyone at work in any capacity.

23
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:17,191
All right, everyone, look.

24
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:19,999
All right, the complaint was
about Jim and Pam...

25
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,761
- No way.
- What?

26
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,548
You guys are together?

27
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:31,393
Yep.

28
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:32,948
Yes, we are.

29
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,192
- Tuna!
- Awesome!

30
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:37,475
I knew it!

31
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:39,337
To the two of you.

32
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:43,782
Toby, was this your fun little way
of congratulating us?

33
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:46,692
- Yes.
- Okay.

34
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:48,610
Mind is exploding.

35
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,327
Get over here.
Come on.

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Come here.

37
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,868
Okay, stand up.

38
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,693
Here we go.

39
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:03,251
Everyone, this is a day
that will live in infamy.

40
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:05,206
Because today...

41
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:06,674
is the day...

42
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:08,496
that Jim and Pam...

43
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,827
- become one.
- Actually, we're dating for 2 months.

44
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:15,096
I love you guys so much.

45
00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:22,946
- Phone's ringing.
- No, no. Pam, let'em ring.

46
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:27,984
Let the bells of Dunder-Mifflin
chime out your love.

47
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:29,473
Because...

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,929
this is really good.
This is really good.

49
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:36,147
My heart soars...

50
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,494
with the eagle's nest.

51
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:41,839
I don't see it.
I think they both could do better.

52
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,108
It's not a surprise to me.

53
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:46,680
Pam is the office mattress.

54
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:48,420
Jim Halpert's off the market.

55
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,016
Guess who just became the best looking
single guy in the office?

92
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:28,447
Can you make that straighter?

93
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:30,471
That's what she said.

94
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,257
Did you plan that?

95
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:33,880
No.

96
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,801
"Can you make that straighter?"

97
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:38,098
"That job looks hard."

98
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:40,789
"You should put your mouth on that."

99
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,410
How can you even use that one naturally?

100
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,186
Blowing up balloons, I thought.

101
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,315
You might wanna trim it a little?

102
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:49,983
- Michael.
- Oh, is Ryan coming back today?

103
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:52,204
Yeah, he is.

104
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:58,061
Pam and Jim are together.
Ryan is visiting.

105
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:02,123
Only thing that could make
this day better is ice cream.

106
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,383
What do you want?

107
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:08,421
To give you this.

108
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:12,662
- What is that?
- It's a ferel barn cat.

109
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,667
I trapped him
and I'm giving him to you

110
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:16,828
as a replacement cat
for the one I destroyed.

111
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,887
Her name was Sprinkles.

112
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:22,209
And his name is Garbage.

113
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:25,188
Most calls him Garbage
'cause he likes to eat garbage.

114
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,450
Don't you, Garbage?

115
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,338
I can't believe you just thought
you could replace Sprinkles,

116
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:31,935
before she's even in the ground.

117
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:33,769
You haven't buried her yet?

118
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:36,093
Don't rush me.
I'm grieving.

119
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:39,394
Garbage can be very helpful, okay?
He's a useful cat.

120
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:41,696
He killed an entire family of raccoons.
Look at him.

121
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:43,894
I don't want Garbage.

122
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:45,496
I want Sprinkles!

123
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:00,439
Hey Toby.

124
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,293
Hey, Pa...

125
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:04,546
- You two.
- Hey.

126
00:05:04,706 --> 00:05:07,094
So now that we are dating,

127
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:09,645
we just wanted to know
if we had to sign one of those

128
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:11,464
"we're dating" things for the company.

129
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,090
Oh, well, you know, those are only for,

130
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,278
you know, relationships.

131
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:21,908
So... if it's just a casual thing,
there's no need, really.

132
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:26,995
Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim,
but it's, like, pretty official.

133
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,030
Sorry, so do we need to...
sign one, or...

134
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,758
Let's just wait and see what happens,
you know.

135
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,543
- What?
- Well, let's just wait.

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,035
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

137
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:45,195
Great.

138
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,489
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hold on one sec.

139
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:06,311
Hey, Pam. It's great to see you.
Is Michael in?

140
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,606
- Hey, there he is!
- Yeah.

141
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:10,754
He's back!
And he's with a beard.

142
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,028
He has facial hair.

143
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:14,577
Look at him!

144
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:17,061
All grown up and no place to go.

145
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,056
Hello, M. Sonny Crocket.

146
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
I'm Tubbs.

147
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,769
Okay.
Should we get started?

148
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:25,315
Yeah, let's get started
because, uh, yes.

149
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:28,007
- 'Cause this is very serious business.
- Yeah, exactly.

150
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,552
This is a business meeting.

151
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:31,042
- Fire guy!
- Stop that!

152
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:35,006
That's right! Fire guy!
Don't start any fires, Ryan.

153
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,103
Fire guy!

154
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,441
- You weren't here for that.
- Here for what?

155
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:40,611
- When he started the fire.
- Look how big he is.

156
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,536
Look at you!
You are so...

157
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,533
mature and old
and little man now.

158
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:48,783
- You're like our little man.
- Little old man boy.

159
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:51,414
- Michael, everybody...
- Bearded like man boy.

160
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:54,028
Let me say something.
I know I used to be a temp here,

161
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,764
but now everything is different.

162
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,176
I'd like your respect.

163
00:06:57,361 --> 00:07:00,529
I'm your boss now. You're gonna have to
treat me the same way you treated Jan.

164
00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:03,266
- So...
- That's a little kinky.

165
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:04,699
I don't swing that way.

166
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,162
- I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
- Enough, okay!

167
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,725
This is inappropriate
and it stops right now.

168
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,851
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

169
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:19,468
Everybody, come on.
Settle down.

170
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:20,911
Let's get serious here.

171
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:24,914
Ryan has a very special
important presentation to do

172
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:27,560
which we will be doing
in the conference room in ten minutes.

173
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,365
- Perfect.
- Sound good? Okay.

174
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:30,607
All right.

175
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,037
Yeah, Ryan snapped at me.

176
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:36,135
Bu there was this twinkle in his eye
that I picked up on which said,

177
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:38,044
"Dude, we're friends.

178
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,709
"I'm doing this for appearances.

179
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,492
"I'm the big boss now.

180
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:43,377
"And I have to seem like an ogre.

181
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:44,730
"But you know me

182
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,793
"and you trust me,
"and we like each other.

183
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,013
"And we'll always be friends.

184
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,232
"And I would never take you for granted
"in a million years.

185
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:59,313
"And I miss you, man.
"And I love you."

186
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,458
His words.

187
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:10,792
Dunder-Mifflin Infinity represents
a floor to ceiling streamlining

188
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,187
of our business model.

189
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:13,795
The center piece of the campaign

190
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:17,122
is a new business to business
website interface

191
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:20,552
that will allow us
to compete directly with big box chains.

192
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,105
Wait a second.

193
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,776
Last time I checked,
Dunder-Mifflin already has a website.

194
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:28,448
And quite frankly, I'm not really sure
what's wrong with it.

195
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:32,105
This is a massive overhaul.
We're getting younger,

196
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:36,329
sleeker and more agile with the way
that we adapt to the marketplace.

197
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:39,321
Essential personal will be issued
blackberries for company use.

198
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:40,470
Gimme, gimme.

199
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,967
I'll stick around for a while
to help you set them up.

200
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:44,271
Any questions?

201
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:49,283
What if we don't wanna use a blackberry
because they are stupid and pointless?

202
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:51,118
- This's company-wide, Dwight.
- Got it.

203
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,598
You should call it
Dunder-Mifflinfinity.

204
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,744
You know, push the words together.

205
00:08:58,173 --> 00:08:59,510
Any other questions?

206
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,012
Can we speak privately
about our relationship?

207
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:05,809
Thank you, everybody!

208
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:08,697
Ryan Howard everybody!
Good job!

209
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,495
That was some fun stuff.
When's the website go up?

210
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,157
As fast as possible.
We wanna start re-training people ASAP,

211
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:18,202
to hit the ground running
with the new system.

212
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:19,437
Cool beans.

213
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,424
- We're screwed.
- Who is?

214
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:24,903
Us, you and me.
The old timers.

215
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:26,944
I am not old.
You are old.

216
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:28,926
You are, like, a 100.

217
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,739
You're over 40.
That's the cut off.

218
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,141
Are you listening to what he's saying?
Re-training.

219
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:35,922
New system, youth.

220
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:38,277
I'm telling you,
this kid is the grim reaper.

221
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,892
You deal with this,

222
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,696
or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis,
the chick you hit with the car,

223
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:44,275
we're goners.

224
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,741
I swore
I wouldn't tell anybody this, but...

225
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:51,761
in the interest of...

226
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:53,436
revealing secrets...

227
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,063
Oh, my god, this is gonna make
your brain explode.

228
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:00,650
Dwight and Angela...
dating.

229
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:03,620
Have been for six months.

230
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:05,209
Swear to god.

231
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:06,736
This is great.

232
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:09,911
I was gonna wait and tell you on your
birthday, but this is much more fun.

233
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:13,543
No, they have been dating
for, like, two years.

234
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:16,424
Since before your barbeque.

235
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:19,817
Wait, what?

236
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:23,486
You knew.
And you didn't say anything?

237
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:25,368
You didn't say anything to me.

238
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:27,941
Fair enough.

239
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:32,455
We should have started dating,
like, a long time ago.

240
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:35,158
Sorry, I didn't know
you guys were in here.

241
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:38,148
- No, we're just sitting here.
- I couldn't see your hands.

242
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,418
Oh, hey Pam, by the way,
it's great that you're dating.

243
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,944
But when a new client calls,

244
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:48,380
you just have to randomly assign them
to a sales person.

245
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:51,786
You can't base who gets new clients
on who you're sleeping with that week.

246
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:53,251
Okay?

247
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:54,821
- Okay.
- Okay.

248
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:56,116
Okay.

249
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,573
And... that is why
we waited so long to tell people.

250
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:13,363
- Okay, what's up?
- Yeah, okay.

251
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:14,779
Um, I was just...

252
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:17,178
After the presentation,
wanted to make sure

253
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:20,213
that vis-a-vis me in the office,
everything is business as usual.

254
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:22,623
Well, it's business but not as usual.

255
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:24,658
Yeah, no, I understand.

256
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:27,739
We're making great strides
and you're updating.

257
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,145
- But business as usual, no?
- No.

258
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:33,082
We threw out the playbook,
we start from scratch.

259
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:34,879
We're implementing a brand new system.

260
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,644
- Good, so we're on the same page.
- No.

261
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,668
We're not.

262
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:43,479
Michael, I know exactly

263
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:47,467
how much time and manpower
are waisted in this branch.

264
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:51,322
This company is getting younger,
faster, more efficient.

265
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,335
You need to prepare yourself.

266
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,456
We had a foreign exchange student
live with us when I was young.

267
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:01,730
And we called him my brother.
And that's what I thought he was.

268
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,521
Um, and then he went home
to what is now formerly Yugoslavia,

269
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,197
taking all of my blue jeans with him.

270
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:14,290
And I just spent
the entire winter in shorts.

271
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,730
That is what Ryan is like:

272
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,905
a fake brother who steals your jeans.

273
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:26,615
So...

274
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,594
- How are you?
- Awesome.

275
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:30,334
I am dating a lot of guys.

276
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:32,530
- Good.
- A lot. Black guys, mostly.

277
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:34,725
What?

278
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:38,504
Wait...

279
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,815
How do you touch
just one of these buttons at a time?

280
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:43,428
I don't know.

281
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,858
Did you even try?

282
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:48,577
If the kid wants to set mine up,
I'll let him.

283
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:50,907
I can't see half the things.

284
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,725
It's too little.
Use the phone.

285
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:57,476
I want you to tell me that you care
about me. That is what I want.

286
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:59,278
Kelly, I'm your boss now, okay?

287
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:01,419
Stop talking to me
like I'm your boyfriend.

288
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,756
Oh, big strong man.
Fancy new whatever.

289
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,190
- You never cared about me.
- I never cared about you?

290
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,175
Six months ago, Karen Filippelli
sent me an email asking me out.

291
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:12,541
I said no because
I was committed to our relationship.

292
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:15,114
Well, I hope you're still committed,
because I'm pregnant.

293
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:21,102
And guess what buddy?
I am keeping it.

294
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,233
- You feel prepared to raise a baby?
- I ca...

295
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,444
I can't talk about this right now, okay?
After work, we'll go out to dinner,

296
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,370
we'll talk about it then, okay?

297
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,600
We have a date!

298
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:42,511
- Hello.
- Hello, Dwight.

299
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,000
I've been thinking about things...

300
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:51,271
and I wanted to know if
you would have dinner with me tonight.

301
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:52,412
Really?

302
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:53,373
Yes.

303
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:57,095
I'll make a reservation.
No, no, let me cook for you.

304
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:00,156
Cauliflower and noodles.
Baked potato on the side.

305
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,830
I would prefer a public place.

306
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:05,111
See you after work.

307
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:13,144
- Hi, Pam.
- Hi.

308
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:15,294
- Is Michael in?
- In his office. Go right in.

309
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:24,022
So, elephant in the room,
I have your old job.

310
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:28,137
Well, not exactly... my job.

311
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:30,325
- A different title.
- Oh, well, excuse me.

312
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:32,030
Same office.
Same responsibilities.

313
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:33,477
Different salary.

314
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:36,028
You'll get there.
Don't worry.

315
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:38,639
- You look great.
- Thank you.

316
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,175
- Thank you.
- Scranton seats you.

317
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:43,059
Best decision I ever made.

318
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,344
You were let go.

319
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:48,298
You know what?
Love the beard, keep it forever.

320
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:55,947
What is the actual deal
with these things in terms of testicles?

321
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:57,524
What?

322
00:14:57,712 --> 00:15:00,858
I don't wanna grow weird sperm
in case we ever wanna have kids.

323
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,055
So what's Ryan doing here?

324
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:10,651
I don't know. They're launching
a big new business plan, a new website.

325
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:14,690
He's being a real twerp about it though.

326
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:19,560
It's all about youth,
and agily, and streamlining.

327
00:15:20,573 --> 00:15:23,473
- Try to squeeze out the older people.
- He's such a snake.

328
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,041
Hope he gets them an ageism suit.

329
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:29,114
What is that word?

330
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,386
Ageism?

331
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:34,782
The companies, they can't discriminate
against people due to old age.

332
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:38,175
Two years ago, we tried to force out
some of the older branch managers

333
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:41,326
with a mandatory retirement age
and then Ed Truck, your old boss,

334
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:44,625
threatened us with a lawsuit.
So, we had to back off.

335
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:47,152
So older people have just
as many rises as younger people.

336
00:15:48,306 --> 00:15:49,751
Yes, Michael.

337
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:51,956
They do.

338
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:17,020
- Creed?
- Yes, sir?

339
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,663
- Everything okay?
- Everything's cool, dude.

340
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,067
I'm 30.

341
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, in november, I'll be 30.

342
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:27,215
Another meeting's scheduled?

343
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,339
I was gonna do
the blackberry tutorial, in here.

344
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,359
Michael told us to wait in here,
we don't know why.

345
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,070
Oh, man.

346
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,830
Good, we're all here.

347
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,546
- We can get started.
- Michael.

348
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:41,708
Have a seat.

349
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:43,766
Have a seat like everybody else.

350
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:45,496
Okay, this is for everyone's...

351
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:47,185
Still my office, Ryan.

352
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:56,634
Well, there has been a lot of talk

353
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,523
about new ideas today.
Well...

354
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,633
new ideas are fine.

355
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:04,208
But they are also illegal.

356
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:07,524
Because they are a form of ageism.

357
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:09,963
What?
Yes, I am right.

358
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:12,225
Did you know...

359
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,204
that the age discrimination
and employment act of 1967

360
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:20,515
prohibits employment discrimination
based on age with respect to employees

361
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,588
40 years of age or older?

362
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:23,685
I did.

363
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:25,482
Technically, he's right.

364
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:26,898
Hey, shut up, Toby.

365
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:31,485
Why do we as a society
hate old people so much?

366
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:33,503
- Because they're lame.
- No!

367
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,644
Creed, no, they are not.

368
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:40,086
In fact,
many cultures revere old people

369
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:44,083
<i>because of their storytelling ability.
Like the old lady from Titanic.</i>

370
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,919
Or the funny things that they can do,
like, "Where's the beef?"

371
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,770
- Yeah.
- Why the big picture's up again?

372
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,735
You used that when you burned your foot.

373
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:55,404
We were using the Ben Kingsley too.

374
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:58,971
I was going to put up
some new pictures, but,

375
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:01,699
all of the ink in the printer was gone.

376
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:05,758
- Michael Scott?
- That is me! Come on in.

377
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,169
Whis this old fart?

378
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:12,791
Did you just stagger off the street,
out of a box or something?

379
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,912
Who's this worthless bag of bones?

380
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:19,246
Well, this guy is none other than one
of the founders of Dunder-Mifflin,

381
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:20,686
Mr. Robert Dunder.

382
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:24,097
Oh, yeah!

383
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:25,900
Yes!

384
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,719
- Michael, can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure thing.

385
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:31,618
Excuse me.

386
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:35,928
- We've actual work to do.
- Fine.

387
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:38,577
Then I'll call David Wallace
and you can explain to him

388
00:18:38,737 --> 00:18:42,281
why you threw the founder
of the company out on his ancient butt.

389
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:47,918
Bob, how old are you?

390
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:51,594
- I'm 87.
- 87 years young.

391
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:53,439
And still tive.

392
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:54,648
That is great.

393
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:58,044
Did you know that Bob is still a member
of the board of Dunder-Mifflin?

394
00:18:58,223 --> 00:19:01,805
Well, I haven't been
to a board meeting in years.

395
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:03,663
I send a proxy.

396
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,397
Still sends his own proxy.
Good for you.

397
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,040
I'm going to live for a very long time.

398
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,663
My grandma Schrute lived to be 101.

399
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:14,987
My grandpa Mannheim is 103,

400
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,740
and still puttering
around down in Argentina.

401
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:19,254
I tried to go visit him once

402
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:22,471
but my travel visa was protested
by the Shoah foundation.

403
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:26,129
I started this company in 1949.

404
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:30,342
Back then,
it was an industrial supplier

405
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:33,690
of metal brackets,
mostly for construction.

406
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:34,948
Oh, boy.

407
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:38,070
And then Mifflin,
of course he killed himself later,

408
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:41,662
but I knew Mifflin
through the rotary club.

409
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:42,723
Great.

410
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:43,961
He was...

411
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:48,066
He was at dinner
with Beverly and her husband.

412
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,776
What was his name?

413
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:51,881
Uh,`jerry.

414
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,780
Jerry Trupiano...
from South Jersey.

415
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,632
And he was tall.

416
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,253
Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.

417
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:01,844
Great.
That's great.

418
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:03,467
Thank you for coming in.

419
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:05,040
Robert Dunder, everybody.

420
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:07,329
Thank you.
That was wonderful.

421
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,451
- Do you have a ride?
- Well, I came here in a cab.

422
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:12,820
- Perfect.
- Well, could you give me another...

423
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:14,491
Inspirational.

424
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:15,941
What have we learned?

425
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:20,320
Well, we have learned that
you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

426
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:23,803
Because it's illegal
and you will go to jail.

427
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,105
I should help him get home.

428
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,809
No, no, don't help him!
He doesn't need help, Pam.

429
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:38,375
What a nice guy.

430
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:41,558
Good night, guys.

431
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,520
Well, today was
a fantastic waste of time.

432
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,691
I disagree.
It think it was very valuable.

433
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:50,094
Michael,
technology helps business, okay?

434
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:52,784
You shouldn't resist it.
This is the way the world is moving.

435
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:55,661
I happen to think that old ways
of doing business are better.

436
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,102
And I can prove it.

437
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,833
- Okay.
- I look forward to hearing your ideas.

438
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:04,624
- Where do you wanna go?
- Some place romantic and expensive.

439
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:05,876
Kelly, come on.

440
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,343
You know what? You're right.
I'm feeling kind of nauseous, anyway.

441
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,374
So...
we can just skip it.

442
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:19,525
Are you enjoying
your vegetarian noodles?

443
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:21,026
Very much.

444
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:23,365
How is your meat?

445
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:25,761
Dry, delicious.

446
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:33,285
- I heard a joke today.
- Oh, that's funny.

447
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:35,666
Yes, it was.

448
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:41,447
Are you enjoying your mineral water?

449
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,979
- I can't do this.
- What?

450
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:45,602
I can't be with you.

451
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,251
Every time I look in your eyes,
I see Sprinkles' stiff, lifeless body.

452
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:52,561
Then don't look in my eyes.

453
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:55,237
Look right here.
It's an old sales trick.

454
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,298
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:58,386
I gave this everything I could.

456
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:00,925
No, please don't do this, monkey.

457
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:04,638
I will leave your toothbrush
on top of your tire tomorrow morning.

458
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:13,127
Smell that.

459
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:14,947
You smell that?

460
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:17,347
- Dry rot.
- No, Dwight.

461
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,420
That smells like good business to me.

462
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,666
What I've done here,

463
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:24,924
is I have collected the finest gourmet
items that Scranton has to offer.

464
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:27,705
- Sweet, chocolate turtles.
- Yes. Nope!

465
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:30,218
No, those are for our clients.

466
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:32,268
Actually, our ex-clients.
I'll explain later.

467
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,588
Ryan wants everything in our company
to be about emails and I.M.S.

468
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:42,745
But I think he is forgetting
about the original instant message.

469
00:22:44,648 --> 00:22:48,296
Letters attached to baskets of food.

470
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,391
Excuse me, Angela.

471
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:59,113
Michael asked me to turn in these
receipts for these gift basket items.

472
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:01,254
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

473
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,390
- Is that all?
- Yes.

474
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:10,010
I miss you.

475
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:11,801
Elevators.

476
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:14,644
Dwight, you have to listen to me.

477
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:17,612
We are not seeing each other anymore.

478
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:19,356
Can you accept that?

479
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:22,640
Fine.

480
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,312
Then I just wanna be friends.

481
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,381
Good.

482
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,875
Plus a little extra.

483
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:29,285
Also, I love you.

484
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,673
I don't understand what the big deal is.

485
00:23:34,852 --> 00:23:37,093
- You lied about being pregnant.
- Right, so?

486
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:39,462
You really don't understand
why that makes me angry?

487
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:41,737
- No.
- We're never getting back together.

488
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:42,897
Why not?

489
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,804
All right, I just have to ask.

490
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,864
Now that we're public...

491
00:23:55,594 --> 00:23:56,617
is the magic gone?

492
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:00,880
It's funny you bring that up,
because yes, it is.

493
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
I knew it.

494
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:04,897
Oh, man.

495
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,318
- Just like that, huh?
- I think...

496
00:24:08,332 --> 00:24:10,933
I mean, I don't--
I don't know what it is, but...

497
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:14,659
- Be honest.
- I now find you repulsive.

498
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:16,532
That's honest.

499
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,537
All right, fair enough.

500
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:25,304
It was really fun
while it lasted, though, wasn't it?

501
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,462
Yeah.

502
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,043
For me it was.

503
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:29,566
Okay.

504
00:24:30,193 --> 00:24:31,193
All right.

505
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:39,568
Hey, boss.
I didn't know you were coming in today.

506
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,630
What's, uh, going on here?

507
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,394
I am glad that you asked.
Listen up, everybody!

508
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,913
In the last year, we have lost
seven clients to the big chains.

509
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:52,933
These gift baskets
are our ticket back into their lives.

510
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:56,289
We are going to show up
at these businesses unannounced,

511
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:59,798
- and we are going to win them back.
- With gift baskets.

512
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,431
With peanut brittle.

513
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,686
With macadamia nut cookies.

514
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:07,132
With chocolate turtles.

515
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:09,413
With raspberry jam.

516
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:12,703
And a little bit of fat and salt.

517
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:15,076
Because you know what?
That's what people like.

518
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,064
Ever since I was a kid,

519
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,472
people have been telling me
that I can't do things.

520
00:25:19,632 --> 00:25:21,229
"You can't be on the team."

521
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:23,284
"You can't move on to second grade."

522
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:27,315
Well, now they're telling me
that I can't win back clients

523
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:29,779
using old fashioned business methods.

524
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:31,485
We'll see about that.

525
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:35,196
And FYI,
I eventually hated second grade.

526
00:25:35,356 --> 00:25:37,387
And I was the biggest kid in class.

527
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,941
Okay, we're gonna split up into teams.

528
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:42,797
Jim, Phyllis;
Stanley, Dwight;

529
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:43,880
me, Andy.

530
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,446
I'm not driving with him.

531
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:47,427
- I'll go with you, Stanley.
- Or him.

532
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:50,456
- Why don't we just go by ourselves?
- Why don't we just go as teams

533
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,129
to demonstrate our teamsmenship.

534
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:54,322
This is stupid.

535
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,443
What-- okay.
That's not helpful, Phyllis.

536
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:59,661
How is giving people gift baskets
going to get our clients back?

537
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:04,534
Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis.
Gift baskets are...

538
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:08,725
the essence of class and fanciness.

539
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:11,551
They are the ultimate present
that a person can receive.

540
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:12,673
What about cash?

541
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,764
Cash can buy whatever you want,
including a gift basket, so...

542
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:17,738
it's kind of the best gift ever.

543
00:26:17,898 --> 00:26:20,425
- What about a gift basket full of cash?
- Yes!

544
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:22,037
Cash basket!
Nice work, Tuna.

545
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:25,641
Fine, I'm just gonna go by myself,
and I am going to win them back

546
00:26:25,892 --> 00:26:28,273
by myself.
Because this is important to me.

547
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,108
Michael, wait.

548
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:32,086
Let me go.

549
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:34,525
No, this is my quest.

550
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:37,214
Please let me go.

551
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,247
I need to win those clients back.

552
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,742
- Please.
- Fine.

553
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:44,611
Then god speed.

554
00:26:45,835 --> 00:26:46,835
To both of us.

555
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,078
Good luck, Michael.

556
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:51,666
We don't need luck.

557
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:52,854
Yeah.

558
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,420
But thank you,
that was really nice of you to say.

559
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,292
Business to business.
The old fashioned way.

560
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,726
No blackberries, no websites.

561
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:06,202
I would like to see a website
deliver baskets of food to people.

562
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:10,303
Yes, I understand that, David.

563
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,792
I just felt
that if we were to downsize Kelly,

564
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:16,227
and then outsource customer service
to India, which a lot of companies...

565
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:19,138
Yes, no--
Yes, Kelly is indian.

566
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:21,547
I understand that's confusing.

567
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:24,891
Hey, brah.
Been meaning to ask you,

568
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:26,961
can we get some Red Bull
for these things?

569
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:29,872
Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull.
Am I right?

570
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:31,172
Later, skater.

571
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,816
Sweet ride.

572
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:38,257
American made.
What happened to the sebring?

573
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,732
It is in the body shop.

574
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:43,948
I had to have the dent taken out
of the hood where I hit Meredith.

575
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:45,981
- That's a pain in the ass.
- I know.

576
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:48,071
- So who's next?
- Larry Meyers.

577
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,751
Left us six months ago for Office Depot.

578
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:55,291
<i>Proceed to the highlighted route
then route guidance will begin.</i>

579
00:27:55,451 --> 00:27:56,714
Why do you use that thing?

580
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:58,824
It lets them know
where you are at all times.

581
00:27:58,984 --> 00:27:59,821
Who?

582
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:04,033
The government,
spy satellites, private detectives.

583
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,221
Ex-girlfriends.

584
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:19,272
Next night, I'm out at a bar, 2:00 AM.
I figure I'll get a sandwich.

585
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,598
'Cause you can get a sandwich any time
of the night. I run into Vince Vaughn.

586
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:25,548
- No way.
- Literally.

587
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,994
Dude, you are so money.

588
00:28:28,777 --> 00:28:31,505
But you dot even know it.
But you do.

589
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:34,690
- Later, guys.
- Yeah...

590
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:36,921
- Later, dude.
- Later, man.

591
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:43,621
How awesome is Ryan now?

592
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,568
Yeah, he's definitely something.

593
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,591
- What does that mean?
- That whole lifestyle

594
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:51,461
his whole vibe?
You find that appealing?

595
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,071
Tuna!

596
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:00,482
He has a killer job.

597
00:29:00,732 --> 00:29:01,840
He's rich.

598
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:05,422
He smells like what I think
Pierce Brosnan probably smells like.

599
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:08,490
He wears really cool rich guy cloth.

600
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:11,493
And he can get any girl that he wants.

601
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:15,527
So, sorry, Tuna,
but if you don't know why that awesome,

602
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:17,186
then...

603
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,240
you need awesome lessons.

604
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,550
Tuna, check ya later.

605
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,127
'Cause he's so money
that he doesn't even know it.

606
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,008
Those things are heavy.

607
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:32,333
There's a lot of stuff in there.
We have...

608
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:35,122
macadamia nut cookies,

609
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:37,708
the honey mustard pretzels.

610
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:40,556
Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?

611
00:29:40,721 --> 00:29:42,392
You know we closed our account, right?

612
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:44,597
- Yes, we do.
- We're with Office Depot now.

613
00:29:44,804 --> 00:29:46,082
- Yes.
- Yes, we know.

614
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,603
- But we just have not gotten over you.
- Well...

615
00:29:48,763 --> 00:29:51,843
And we are dedicated to providing you
with the very best customer service.

616
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:55,273
- This is true.
- The best personal business relation...

617
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:58,082
We can if you ever decide
to come back to us.

618
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,857
Okay.
I don't think we're coming back.

619
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:03,310
- Please come back.
- Okay, you know what?

620
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:05,014
Just enjoy the gift basket...

621
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:08,680
and remember
that we provide a personal touch.

622
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,156
Remember what we had, Larry?

623
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,389
I mean, really, it's about money.

624
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:14,239
Well, just enjoy the gift basket.

625
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:16,815
- Okay, than.
- All right.

626
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,505
I mean, their website's really easy
to use too. That's a big deal for us.

627
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:24,216
That guy was so st...

628
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,088
How can't they know
how much better we are?

629
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:30,275
I don't know. Sometimes people are just
impossible and make you miserable.

630
00:30:30,435 --> 00:30:31,339
That is true.

631
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:32,775
Like Angela in accounting.

632
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:34,264
Yes, she is nuts.

633
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:36,646
No, she's wonderful.

634
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:38,149
At accounting.

635
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:40,300
But she drives me crazy.

636
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:43,466
<i>Make the next right turn.</i>

637
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:45,945
How do they know?
How does this know where to turn?

638
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:47,328
That's very impressive.

639
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,375
Hey, Pam.

640
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:52,921
I haven't settled on a final design logo
yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity.

641
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:55,745
And I know you're into graphic design.
You wanna give it a shot?

642
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:58,451
- Maybe try and design the logo?
- Uh, totally.

643
00:30:58,644 --> 00:31:00,552
Cool.
That would be great.

644
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:03,212
Can you do a couple mock-ups
and I'll take a look?

645
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,135
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

646
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:06,544
- Cool.
- Okay.

647
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:14,832
Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock-ups

648
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:17,404
and then turn those into thumbnails.

649
00:31:17,564 --> 00:31:21,272
Maybe do some, uh, splash frames.

650
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:24,211
I don't know what I'm talking about,
but I'm excited.

651
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:27,601
And the last guy says, no, Harry Body.

652
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:29,876
You know I have heard it before.

653
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:33,037
Well, it's still very good.

654
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,576
I bet I know someone
who hasn't heard that joke.

655
00:31:36,736 --> 00:31:38,536
Your daugther Emily.
How's she doing?

656
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,368
She's great.
Thanks for asking.

657
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:43,259
Great memory, by the way.

658
00:31:43,678 --> 00:31:45,985
She gonna be, like, 11...
this winter?

659
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,890
They grow up so fast.

660
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:50,934
I have a few of my own
that I want someday.

661
00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:55,211
I don't wanna take any more
of your time, you're a busy man.

662
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,891
The reason we have stopped by
is to drop you off

663
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:00,533
this elaborate bag of goodies.

664
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,908
And to ask you to reconsider.

665
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:04,370
Oh, okay.

666
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,916
Okay? Okay!
So you'll reconsider?

667
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:09,040
Okay, thanks for the goodies.

668
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:17,252
Is that all you have to say?

669
00:32:19,297 --> 00:32:21,271
It looks delicious?
I don't know.

670
00:32:21,478 --> 00:32:22,658
You don't know?

671
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:25,347
Look...

672
00:32:26,602 --> 00:32:27,810
We want you back.

673
00:32:28,544 --> 00:32:29,889
Can you offer lower prices?

674
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,191
- Well, no.
- Then we're not coming back.

675
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:34,397
- He's not coming back. It's over.
- No, it's not.

676
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:36,933
- No, he's right.
- Accept it, why would he come back?

677
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:39,561
Why would he come back?
I'll tell you, Dwight.

678
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:44,243
He would come back because we offer
a wide selection of products,

679
00:32:44,403 --> 00:32:47,998
and you're not getting the same customer
service that you get with us, are you?

680
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:50,308
That's not gonna change his mind.
He's moving on.

681
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,618
We had our chance and we killed it.

682
00:32:57,821 --> 00:32:58,822
Look...

683
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,651
We're also coming out with a website...
soon.

684
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:06,517
It's a staf-the-art thing.

685
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,331
It'll be up and running.

686
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:13,561
It's gonna cut costs
and it will make ordering much easier.

687
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:16,790
Well, okay.
Well, when it's up, i'll check it out

688
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,196
and if it really cuts costs,
maybe we'll come back.

689
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:22,870
Great.
The magic of the gift basket.

690
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:25,750
That I don't care about as much.
Let me know when the site's up.

691
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,954
Okay.

692
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:28,331
Good.

693
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:31,312
Don't let Emily have any of the almonds.
She's allergic.

694
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,159
<i>Proceed straight.</i>

695
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,161
Well, we're 0 for 6.

696
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,115
Last chance is
the Elmhurst Country Club.

697
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:43,357
Other side of the lake
on the southeast side.

698
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:44,729
I don't get it.

699
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,192
I really don't get it.

700
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:48,044
I thought this would work.

701
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:50,666
I threw everything I had
at that guy, nothing.

702
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:52,981
That's how it goes sometimes, you know?

703
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:56,375
You lose everything,
and everything falls apart.

704
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:59,517
And eventually you die
and no one remembers you.

705
00:33:59,677 --> 00:34:01,046
That is a very good point.

706
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:02,941
<i>Make a right turn.</i>

707
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,866
Wait, wait!
No, no.

708
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:06,542
It means bear right.

709
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,547
- Right there.
- No, it said right.

710
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:09,982
It said, take a right.

711
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:11,288
No, no, look.

712
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:16,325
It means go up to the right, bear right
over the bridge and hook up with 307.

713
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,906
Maybe it's a short cut.
It said, go to the right.

714
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,262
It can't mean that.

715
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:22,465
- It's a lake there!
- It knows where it's going!

716
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,372
- This is the lake!
- The machine knows. Stop yelling at me!

717
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:28,285
No, it's up there!
There's no road here!

718
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:32,796
Remain calm.
I have trained for this.

719
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,061
Okay.

720
00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:35,553
Exit the window!

721
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:38,503
<i>- Here we go.
- Make a U-turn. If possible.</i>

722
00:34:38,753 --> 00:34:40,455
Look out for nature!

723
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:41,971
Michael!

724
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:43,378
Are you okay?

725
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:44,814
Swim for it!

726
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:46,905
I got you!

727
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,065
I got you!

728
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:51,980
Michael!

729
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:55,003
Let go.
Let go off me!

730
00:34:57,793 --> 00:34:58,973
I've got you!

731
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,566
I've got you!

732
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,190
Come on!

733
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,004
Come on!

734
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,269
You sure you're okay?

735
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:34,429
Fine.

736
00:35:34,805 --> 00:35:35,805
Good.

737
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,217
That is what's most important.

738
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,823
Did you get the rental insurance?

739
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:44,643
'Cause that is pretty important too
at a time like this.

740
00:35:52,372 --> 00:35:54,617
What a disaster.
This whole thing.

741
00:35:56,117 --> 00:35:57,367
I'll call a cab.

742
00:35:57,654 --> 00:35:59,761
These people just don't realize

743
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:02,310
what a gift basket means.
They don't get it.

744
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,474
Look, still works.
Old fashioned cell phone.

745
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:05,635
Yeah.

746
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,143
What about that last guy, Aaron?
Is he a jerk...

747
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,583
I don't even know if I want it.

748
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:13,894
Their website, so easy.

749
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:17,746
Yeah, well, you can have
your technology, jackass.

750
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:20,829
- Look where it got us.
- Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton.

751
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:23,300
At the end of East Mountain Road.

752
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,812
- In the lake.
- Hang up.

753
00:36:25,993 --> 00:36:28,455
You know what we're gonna do?
We're walking back.

754
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:31,208
We're walking back to that office.

755
00:36:31,368 --> 00:36:34,634
And we are going to re-claim
our gift basket!

756
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:37,692
We're going to take
what's rightfully ours.

757
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:39,812
We're gonna take a stand, Dwight.

758
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,717
- We're gonna take a stand!
- Take a stand!

759
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:46,306
So plays on the infinity thing
without being obvious...

760
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:47,460
Yeah, definitely.

761
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:50,768
I'd love to do, like, a color version.
Just bring a little color...

762
00:36:50,928 --> 00:36:52,032
I like it a lot.

763
00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:54,075
It's clear and subtle at the same time.

764
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:56,258
It's really good.
You've a real talent for this.

765
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,284
- Thanks.
- I'd love to talk to you about it more.

766
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,809
- That'd be great.
- Do you wanna go out to dinner tonight?

767
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:06,242
- Oh, is it...
- Wear something nice.

768
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:07,815
- No.
- What?

769
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:11,106
- I just... wanted to have dinner.
- I'm sorry.

770
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:14,425
I'm dating Jim.

771
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,190
You're kidding.

772
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,442
We're together.

773
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:25,145
That's great.

774
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,333
That's awesome.

775
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:28,737
Yeah, great.

776
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:34,772
- So let me...
- Yeah.

777
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:37,121
- Let me look at these.
- Okay, great.

778
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:38,615
Great.

779
00:37:46,546 --> 00:37:47,919
I guess he can't get

780
00:37:48,355 --> 00:37:50,544
any girl he wants.

781
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,679
Do you forget something?
What happened to you guys?

782
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:03,933
Give it back.

783
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,087
The gift basket.
Give it back.

784
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:10,054
- What is this?
- It's real simple.

785
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,180
If you don't appreciate what we do,
then give us back our basket.

786
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:15,968
Maybe you should leave.

787
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:18,142
Yeah, maybe we should.

788
00:38:18,794 --> 00:38:20,224
Maybe we should leave.
Come on,

789
00:38:20,446 --> 00:38:21,926
let's leave.
But before we leave,

790
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:26,946
my wet friend and I are gonna wait
for our cabs on your nice couches!

791
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:29,614
Can you call us a cab, please?
I'm gonna-- Oh, sorry!

792
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:31,842
- Look.
- My clothes are so wet.

793
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,304
Nice leather.

794
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:35,678
My shoes are so muddy!

795
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:38,223
All right, here you go.
Take it back!

796
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:40,304
- It's open.
- Yeah, it was mine.

797
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:41,785
What's missing?

798
00:38:42,772 --> 00:38:43,900
The turtles.

799
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:45,806
Where are the turtles?

800
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:47,339
Come on.
Get out of here!

801
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:49,515
Where are the turtles?!

802
00:38:50,337 --> 00:38:53,019
- Where are they?
- I've an announcement to make.

803
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:56,240
We seem to be missing a box
of chocolate turtles with pecans.

804
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,919
And we will not be leaving the premise
until we obtain them.

805
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:02,630
Hand over the turtles now!

806
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:04,679
I ate them, okay?
I ate the turtles.

807
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:05,839
They're gone!

808
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:20,462
We'll bill you.

809
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:25,483
May I have your attention, please?

810
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:30,538
This office will not be using
any new technology ever, starting now.

811
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:32,288
That is not correct.

812
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:35,604
Ryan thinks
that technology is the answer.

813
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:38,492
Well, guess what?
I just drove my car into a lake.

814
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:42,266
- You did what?
- I drove my car...

815
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,456
into a f*ing lake.

816
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:47,815
Why, you may ask, did do this?

817
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,663
Well...
because of a machine.

818
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:54,041
A machine told me
to drive into a lake.

819
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:56,060
And I did it.
I did it

820
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:59,728
because I trusted
Ryan's precious technology.

821
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:01,766
- And look where it got me.
- Into a lake.

822
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,115
Exactly.

823
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,805
Did you get any clients back?

824
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:07,414
Maybe.
Maybe not.

825
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:08,771
Time will tell.

826
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:12,085
But I will tell you one thing,
those gift baskets

827
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:14,871
never endanger anybody's lives.

828
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:20,198
Game, set, match.

829
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:23,975
Point.
Scott.

830
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,891
Game over.

831
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:29,090
End of game.

832
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:43,173
Everyone always wants new things.

833
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:47,602
Everybody likes new inventions,
new technology.

834
00:40:48,151 --> 00:40:50,549
People will never be
replaced by machines.

835
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:55,155
In the end, life and business
are about human connections.

836
00:40:56,514 --> 00:41:00,611
And computers are about
trying to murder you in a lake.

837
00:41:01,513 --> 00:41:03,363
And to me, the choice is easy.
