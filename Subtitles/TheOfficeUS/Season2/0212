1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,792
Well, Lords of the Ring trilogy,
if you see it back to back,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,269
Yeah.... it's really
long, but it's good.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,464
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Pam.

4
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:07,904
Pam, it's Michael. Help me.

5
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:10,067
I need help right now!
Michael, what's wrong?

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,043
I'm hurt. I have hurt myself.

7
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,310
Oh, my God!
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait!

8
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,144
Oh, this is not
looking good, Pam.

9
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,808
Michael, do you need me
to call an ambulance?

10
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,112
No! I want you to pick me up.

11
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,311
Okay.
What's going on?

12
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,082
Wait a sec. I thought you
said that you were hurt.

13
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,521
I am hurt. I hurt my foot. I'm
sorry. Pam, what is going on?

14
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:28,357
I want to come to work, but I
need you to come and pick me up.

15
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,329
Oh, God!
Hey, whoa, Michael.

16
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,764
Oh, God!
It's... Okay. It's Jim.

17
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,165
Just say again really loudly
what happened.

18
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:40,935
Okay, I burned my foot
very badly on my Foreman grill

19
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,840
and I now need someone to come
and bring me in to work.

20
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,471
You burned your foot
on a Foreman grill?

21
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,344
I enjoy having
breakfast in bed.

22
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,907
I like waking up
to the smell of bacon. Sue me.

23
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,954
And since I don't have a
butler, I have to do it myself.

24
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,615
So, most nights
before I go to bed,

25
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,319
I will lay six strips of bacon
out on my George Foreman grill.

26
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,595
Then go to sleep. When I
wake up, I plug in the grill.

27
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,357
I go back to sleep again.

28
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,165
Then I wake up to the smell
of crackling bacon.

29
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,739
It is delicious.
It's good for me.

30
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,570
It's a perfect way
to start the day.

31
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,241
Today, I got up, I stepped onto the
grill, and it clamped down on my foot.

32
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,578
That's it. I don't see what's
so hard to believe about that.

33
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,277
Pam,
could you come get me?

34
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,013
I have to stay
here and answer the phone.

35
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,556
Okay, could someone
come and get me, please? Ryan?

36
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,490
Michael, you should stay home and
rest. There's no toilet paper here.

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,653
Could Ryan... Tell Ryan
to bring toilet paper.

38
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,093
Could you tell him that?

39
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,723
Can you hop?
I tried hopping, Kevin,

40
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,359
and I bumped my elbow
against the wall,

41
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,700
and now my elbow
has a protuberance.

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,437
No one wants to pick me up?

43
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,510
What is going on?

44
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,544
What is going on?

45
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,716
Michael is sick and he wants
one of us to rescue him.

46
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,376
I'm not sick! I'm...
I'm coming, Michael!

47
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,578
I'm gonna save you!

48
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,450
Don't! Is that Dwight?
I do not want Dwight.

49
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,286
Okay! Hold on, Michael,
I am coming! Wait there!

50
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,848
I don't want Dwight!

51
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,917
Michael, why don't you call
your girlfriend?

52
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,360
I don't have a girlfriend.

53
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,193
But you said you went out
with her this weekend.

54
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,358
That was all made up.
Just someone come, okay?

55
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,334
Anyone. Anyone, but Dwight.

56
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,771
What was that?
What was that?

57
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,643
He hit the pole.

58
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,639
It's broken, right? He
can't... Oh, my gosh.

59
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,048
Oh, Dwight. Dwight.

60
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,581
Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh. Is he okay?

61
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,957
He's still driving.

62
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,625
Dwight, you forgot
your bumper.

63
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,294
Hello?
Please don't send Dwight.

64
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,069
Morning, everyone.

65
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,540
Don't freak out.
I forbid anybody to freak out.

66
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:33,768
Clearly, I have had a very serious
accident, but I will recover.

67
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,380
God willing.

68
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,382
I just want to be treated
normally today.

69
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,613
Normal would actually be good, considering
the trauma that I've been through.

70
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,520
You missed two big conference
calls today, one with corporate.

71
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,751
Oh, did you explain why?

72
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,624
No, I didn't mention
that you cooked your foot.

73
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,322
Burned my foot, Pam.

74
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,529
Please stop popping my cast.

75
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,795
Thank you.

76
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,902
So where are you shipping
your foot?

77
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,702
So,
where are you shipping...

78
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,774
Your foot.

79
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,843
Thank you.

80
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,742
Pam, messages, please.

81
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,114
You didn't have any.

82
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,912
Really? Well, it seemed
very important to you earlier

83
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,623
that you needed to
stay and... Do my job?

84
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,626
No. Your job
is being my friend, Pam.

85
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,051
Ow!

86
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,825
God!
It slipped.

87
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,092
What...
Sorry.

88
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,930
It's just that before, you said you
didn't want any special treatment.

89
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,563
I don't want
any special treatment, Pam.

90
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,336
I just want you to treat me
like you would a family member

91
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,310
who's undergone some sort of
serious physical trauma.

92
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,676
I don't think
that's too much to ask.

93
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,772
Do you want some aspirin?
Because you seem a little fussy.

94
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,477
No, I don't want some aspirin.
Yeah, I am fussy.

95
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,109
Aspirin's not gonna
do a damn thing.

96
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,882
I'm sitting here
with a bloody stump of a foot.

97
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,685
Pam, I am Assistant Regional
Manager and I can take care of him.

98
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,257
Part of my duties are to...

99
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,097
What? Part of your
duties are to what? What?

100
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,037
You just said that part of
your duties are to... Something.

101
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,339
No, I didn't. Yes, you
did. What is wrong with you?

102
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,312
What is wrong with you?

103
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,719
Where is my corn bread?
Here you go.

104
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,628
Thank you. Did you get
all dark meat like I like?

105
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,396
Yes, I ordered three full rotisserie
chickens worth of all dark meat.

106
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,164
Where are the yams?
They were out of yams.

107
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,102
I got you creamed spinach.

108
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,300
Did you go to the one
in Stroudsburg? Yes.

109
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,808
And they had no yams?
They had no yams.

110
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,344
How strange.
Because they always have yams.

111
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,638
Oh, man, is that
a Prism DuroSport?

112
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,843
You've seen one of these? Yeah.

113
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,715
They're like an iPod,
only they're better,

114
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,052
because they're chunkier
and more solid.

115
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,648
Roy gave it to me
for Christmas.

116
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,785
I'm trying to figure out
how to put songs on it.

117
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,658
Oh, no, no. Don't go there.

118
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:08,563
I know this Russian website where you
can download songs for two cents apiece.

119
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,636
Really? Yeah, I'll write
down the address for you.

120
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:16,534
Only, the only thing is, is that
all the songs are in Russian.

121
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,607
Kidding.

122
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,438
Oh.

123
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,677
Why would they all be...

124
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,612
Okay, see you later, Pan.

125
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,486
Pan?

126
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,928
Pam. Pam?

127
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,263
Oh, God.

128
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,404
What?
Come here, please.

129
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,203
Tell me before I come there.

130
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,745
I want you to rub butter on my foot. No.

131
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,873
Pam, please? I have Country Crock. No.

132
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,053
Ryan! Ryan!

133
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,120
Ryan!

134
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,153
These covers
are totally indestructible.

135
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,391
Really?
Yeah.

136
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,627
Throw it. I promise
it won't break.

137
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,860
Chuck it.

138
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,008
Oh, no. It's broken.
What?

139
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,543
No, it's fine.
I told you it wouldn't break.

140
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,480
You could throw it all
day long. That is so cool.

141
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,243
Thanks, Dwight.
You're welcome.

142
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,547
So, I guess Pam and Dwight
are friends now.

143
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,754
Oh, God, no.
Dwight isn't my friend.

144
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,329
Oh, my God.
Dwight's kind of my friend.

145
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,431
No, no. No one is helping me
out at all, Mom.

146
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,540
No, I'm not gonna call Jan.

147
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,667
She'd just worry, drive down
here and make a big thing.

148
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,578
Who told you that?

149
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,739
No, it was mutual.

150
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,112
What is Pam doing
chatting with you?

151
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,384
You like candy?

152
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,527
It's all right.

153
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,263
'Cause you're sweeter than
candy. What is wrong with you?

154
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,862
Wow, you just
dive right in.

155
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,003
You know, around age 12, I just
started going for it, you know.

156
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,437
Help!

157
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,875
Oh, God! Oh, help!

158
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,872
Help me.

159
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,506
What happened?
I fell off the toilet.

160
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,777
I'm caught between
the toilet and the wall.

161
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,047
What do you need?
Not you.

162
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,820
Someone else. Get Pam.

163
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,223
I don't think Pam's gonna
wanna come in to the men's room.

164
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:26,231
Get Ryan. He needs to lift me, and
he needs to clean me up a little bit.

165
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,960
Bring a wet towel.

166
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,527
Ryan is dead.

167
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,696
No, he's not.
Dead.

168
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,672
I just saw him.
No.

169
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:39,337
Can you just get up yourself?
You only grilled your foot.

170
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,506
Forget it. I'll just
get up myself.

171
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,514
Help!

172
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,485
Oh, God!

173
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,658
Do you think Dwight's being
a little weird today?

174
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,787
No. He's actually been
really nice and helpful.

175
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,055
And that isn't weird?

176
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,162
Well...

177
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,801
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

178
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:11,272
Phyllis. Oscar. Ryan,
who is supposed to be dead.

179
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,346
Can I ask you all a question?

180
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,075
Do you know what it's like
to be disabled? Oscar?

181
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,518
I had scoliosis as a girl.

182
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:24,317
Never heard of it. No, a real
disability, not a woman's trouble.

183
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,150
When I was a teenager,
I was in an iron lung.

184
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,326
How old are you? No, it...

185
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,757
Look, the point is,

186
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:37,895
I am the only one here who has
a legitimate disability.

187
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,305
Although I'm sure Stanley has
had his fair share of obstacles.

188
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,408
I'm not disabled, and
neither are you. Okay.

189
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,340
What does this look like
to you, Stanley?

190
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,076
Mail Boxes Etc.

191
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,779
Shut it. Okay.

192
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,747
Well. Well, you know what?

193
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,126
Disabilities are not things
to be laughed at

194
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,491
or laughed about.
You people are jerks.

195
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,661
Imagine if you had
left Stevie Wonder

196
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,702
on the floor of that bathroom
instead of me.

197
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,163
Oh, we wouldn't.
We love Stevie Wonder.

198
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,403
I burned my foot!

199
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,671
Okay, 20 minutes, conference
room, everybody's in there!

200
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,777
Dad?

201
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,790
While we are waiting for
our special guest to arrive,

202
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,956
I wanted you all
to take a look

203
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,328
at a few of the many,
many disabled icons

204
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
who have contributed so much
to our society.

205
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,195
Quick question.
Yeah.

206
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,932
Why is Tom Hanks on the wall? Twice.

207
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:51,067
Good question. Forrest
Gump, mentally challenged.

208
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,578
Philadelphia, AIDS.

209
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,341
I think that's from Big.

210
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,106
I don't think so. No.

211
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,684
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano
with Robert Loggia.

212
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,450
He grew into a man overnight,
rare disability. Still works.

213
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,760
A crossword puzzle, Stanley? Seriously,
are you learning nothing here?

214
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,888
Mmm-hmm.

215
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,659
What do you mean, "Mmm-hmm"?

216
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,758
I mean I'm learning nothing. Okay.

217
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,427
Michael Scott.
I'm looking for Michael Scott.

218
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,233
Yes. Right in here.
Good.

219
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,873
Come on in.
Great.

220
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,271
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is our special guest.

221
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,577
Sorry I'm late. Somebody parked
in the handicapped parking space.

222
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,710
Hey, everyone,
I'm Billy Merchant.

223
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,686
You may have seen me
around here before.

224
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,417
I'm the Properties Manager
of this office park.

225
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,856
You are so brave.

226
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,693
You are so brave.
Thank you.

227
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,252
Actually, I've been meaning to
come by here for a long time...

228
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,561
But it's hard for you, right?
Because you're in a wheelchair.

229
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,692
No, I just have a lot
of properties to manage.

230
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,361
Let me ask you something.

231
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,600
How long does it take for you
to do something simple every day?

232
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,732
Like brush your teeth
in the morning.

233
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,471
I don't know, like 30
seconds. Oh, my God.

234
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,380
That's three times
as long as it takes me.

235
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,548
How did you get in your
wheelchair? This morning?

236
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,810
Just like every other morning,
just climbed on in.

237
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:13,014
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Not funny.
Not funny. Hey, hey, relax.

238
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,027
Just joking around here.
Well, that's good.

239
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,718
He still has a sense of humor.

240
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,096
Listen, I've actually used a
chair since I was four years old.

241
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,364
I don't really notice it anymore. Well,
they do. They notice it, don't you?

242
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:28,202
You notice it. It's the first thing you
saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?

243
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,701
I wanna clamp Michael's face
in a George Foreman grill.

244
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,405
So, there were just a couple things
I wanted to remind everybody of.

245
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,345
Okay.
First is parking.

246
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,678
You can't block the freight
entrance with your car

247
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,150
even if your blinkers are on.

248
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,244
Does anybody
have any questions?

249
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:43,948
Yes.

250
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,383
Yeah.

251
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,317
Yes.

252
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,429
Dwight, you have
your hand up.

253
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,861
Ignore him. You know what? We're
not that different, you and I.

254
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,738
When I clamped my foot
into a non-stick grill...

255
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,469
You know what, Michael?
Yeah.

256
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,306
Let me stop you right there. Okay.

257
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,538
And leave.

258
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,945
Did you see
Born on the Fourth of July?

259
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,445
I was under the impression that
Billy would be more like that guy.

260
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,913
What's wrong with that guy?
You mean today?

261
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,650
He stepped on a George Foreman
grill and he burned his foot.

262
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,125
No, not Michael. The moon-faced
kid who crashed into the pole.

263
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,290
He looks like
he has a concussion.

264
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,428
Hey.

265
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,234
I found the pudding cups you wanted
at a gas station in Carbondale!

266
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,540
You did it. Look at you. And
with the plate and the napkin.

267
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,104
Very nice. Thank you,
Ryan. You are very welcome.

268
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,410
Did you get the yams?

269
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,748
No, the gas station in Carbondale
did not have fresh yams.

270
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,848
Oh, okay. I'll just have
the pudding. You sure?

271
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,255
Yeah.
Okay.

272
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,225
You know what? I feel better.

273
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,156
Ryan brought me
some chocolate pudding

274
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,561
and his kindness
healed my foot.

275
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,531
Yeah, baby!
I am feeling better.

276
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,098
My body's literally
healing itself.

277
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,440
It is amazing what the
human body is capable of

278
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,271
when you have
a powerful brain.

279
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,039
I ground up
four extra-strength aspirin

280
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,808
and put them
in Michael's pudding.

281
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,116
I do the same thing with my dog to
get him to take his heartworm medicine.

282
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,686
Oh, finally feel the blood
coursing through my foot veins.

283
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,489
Okay, I think we need
to take him to the hospital...

284
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,550
No, no, no.

285
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,620
...'cause I'm pretty sure
he has a concussion.

286
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,928
Oh, now you feel
some compassion for him.

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,264
He needs to go right now, and
you're his emergency contact.

288
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,634
I think you should go with
him. Why don't you go with him?

289
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,196
I barely know him.
I want Michael to take me.

290
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,209
I can't take you. I don't have
my car, and yours is all vomitty.

291
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,574
You can take my van.

292
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:50,513
Oh, okay. That's great. No, I can't
drive. Jim, why don't you drive?

293
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,647
Fine. We'll go. I'm still
recovering, so let's just...

294
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,482
Ryan, can you get my coat,
please? Slowly, slowly.

295
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,317
Okay, let's just get
to the elevator.

296
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,913
What are you doing?

297
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,186
Vietnam sounds. Stop it.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

298
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,056
Tired.
Dwight, you can't lay down.

299
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,255
Let's take a break.
Wake up.

300
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,891
Wait, here, let me help you,
Dwight. Come on.

301
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,366
Okay, Pam. Thanks.
Get up. Get up.

302
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,335
You're the best.
Just keep him awake.

303
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,371
It smells like chicken soup. I know.

304
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,669
I have to go to the hospital. I know.

305
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,971
Where are we going? I just
wanna say goodbye, okay?

306
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,340
Well, I'll be back, I mean...

307
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,039
Yes, I know, but it's
gonna be different. Why?

308
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,905
It's just hard to explain.

309
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,419
Oh, Pam, you're adorable.
Oh, my goodness.

310
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,014
Come here.
Huggy-hugs.

311
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,418
Shotgun!

312
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,120
You don't think you should
sit in the back with Dwight?

313
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,394
The rules of shotgun are
very simple and very clear.

314
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,401
The first person to shout "shotgun"
when you're within the sight of the car

315
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,302
gets the front seat.
That's how the game is played.

316
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,100
There are no exceptions
for someone with a concussion.

317
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:53,605
Oh, God, a minivan.
What is Meredith's problem?

318
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,510
Well, I think she has a kid. Yeah,
she has one kid and no husband.

319
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,676
She's not gonna find one
driving this thing around.

320
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,619
Where are we going?
Come on, get inside.

321
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,156
Where are we going? We're
going to Chuck E. Cheese.

322
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,682
Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm
so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.

323
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,194
We're going to the hospital,
Michael.

324
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,196
I know. I'm just saying.

325
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,960
Dwight, what are you drinking?
I found it under the seat.

326
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,231
Oh, my God. Dwight, put
that down. I'm thirsty.

327
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,067
No!
Give the bottle to Michael.

328
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,507
Give it to me, Dwight. Just
keep your eyes on the road.

329
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,010
Give me the bottle or you're
fired! You can't fire me.

330
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,013
I don't work in this van.
Give it to me, Dwight.

331
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,480
No.
Give me the bottle!

332
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,141
Will you stop?
Give me the bottle, Dwight!

333
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,548
Michael, stop!
Just give it.

334
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,109
Michael, stop! Stop.
Stop it!

335
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,950
Stop spraying me!
Give me the bottle!

336
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,990
My eyes!
Stop spraying me!

337
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,286
Give me the bottle!

338
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,553
Dwight, what is your
middle name? Danger.

339
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,056
Something with a "K."
It's Kurt.

340
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,863
Wow, I'm so sad
that I know that.

341
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,768
What do I write under
"reason for visit"?

342
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,930
Concussion.

343
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,370
What did you write?
Nothing.

344
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,277
I wrote, "Bringing someone
to the hospital. "

345
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,942
So you thought they meant your
reason for coming to the hospital?

346
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,146
No, no. You know what, Jim?
This isn't about me anymore.

347
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,955
I made a miraculous recovery, which
is more than I can say for him.

348
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,390
Come on, Dwight.

349
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,090
Hi, Michael.
Hi, Dwight.

350
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:26,069
Doctor, what is more serious,
a head injury or a foot injury?

351
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,572
A head injury. Well, you
don't have all the information.

352
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,974
The foot has been fairly severely
burned, and healed quickly, very quickly.

353
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,210
Actually, like, suspiciously
quickly. So I'm ordering a CAT scan.

354
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,044
What is that?

355
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,552
Look, since you have
the machine up and running,

356
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,884
can I just stick my foot in?
We can take a look.

357
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,517
Well, for a burn, you really just need
to look at the outside of the foot.

358
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,356
Okay, what kind
of machine is that?

359
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,521
Does the skin look
red and swollen?

360
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,124
That's what she said. That's
my joke. Damn it, Dwight.

361
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,970
Okay, no electronics past this
point. Camera, sound equipment...

362
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,032
It's okay, they're with me.
No metal of any kind.

363
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,873
All right, well, I guess this
is where we leave you off.

364
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,037
I don't wanna do this.

365
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,445
You should have thought of that
before you crashed your head

366
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:14,976
on your way to pick me up. So,
we'll see you when you get out.

367
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,349
Oh.

368
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,283
Fine. Fine.

369
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,535
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.

370
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,307
Oh, my God. What's going on?
Is Dwight okay?

371
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,815
He should be fine, but they
brought him in for a CAT scan.

372
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,976
I can't believe
he's getting a CAT scan.

373
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,714
Michael went in there with
him, too. It's pretty sweet.

374
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,881
Really? Michael went
in with him? Mmm-hmm.

375
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,784
Wow. But they shouldn't
be much longer now.

376
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,692
So we'll be back soon.
Okay, that's good news.

377
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,521
Yeah, no, I'll let you go.

378
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,587
Okay.
Okay.

379
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,860
Bye.
Bye.

380
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,734
Hey, Oscar.
What's up, Pam?

381
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,075
I just wanted to let you know
that Dwight's gonna be okay.

382
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,775
The doctor said there's a really
simple treatment for a concussion.

383
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,010
So he'll probably even be
back at work tomorrow.

384
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,020
Okay. I just thought
you'd wanna know that.

385
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:33,757
Okay, Mr. Schrute, inhale
with me on three. One, two...

386
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,827
Sir! Stop that. Stop.

387
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:38,961
Stop that.
