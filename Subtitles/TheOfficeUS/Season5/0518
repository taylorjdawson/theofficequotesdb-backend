00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,363
Hi.

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,903
Good morning.
Can I help you?

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:08,566
Yes. I'm from
Tech Star, about
a new phone system for you.

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:12,236
I was wondering
if I could talk
to Michael Scott?

5
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,837
I'm sorry.
He's not in right now.

6
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,678
SALESMAN: Really?
He's never around
when I come by.

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,740
Shoot.

8
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,681
They have new
phone systems now

9
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,949
that can ring
directly to a salesman,

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,423
or someone presses star
and they go to accounting.

11
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,858
Basically, 95% of my job.

12
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,623
But I'd like to see
a machine that puts out
candy for everyone.

13
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,130
Vending machine.

14
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,426
How about I make
an appointment
to come back?

15
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,904
That way I know
he'll be here.

16
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,906
That is a great idea.

17
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,033
Great.

18
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:51,341
Oh, boy!
Let's see.
He's really...

19
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,849
Michael Scott, manager.
Hi, how are you?

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,080
Hi.
There he is.

21
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,144
Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,621
Great. Look at that.

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,419
I can assure you
we don't need
a new system, though.

24
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,550
We're happy with ours.

25
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:01,616
Hello. May I help you?

27
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:05,988
Jim.

28
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,025
Aye!

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,532
Aye!

30
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,167
Aye!

ALL: Aye!

32
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,519
Okay. I'm going
to get going then.

33
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,884
ALL: Aye!

34
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,289
(LAUGHING)

35
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,288
What was that?
That was funny.

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,725
That was funny.

37
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,524
Let's go do it
to somebody else.

38
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,790
Aye!

39
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,854
Look at that.

40
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,384

Really shoving our
faces in it this year.

41
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,892
You doing okay, bud?

42
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,024
I miss Stacy.

43
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,230
Yeah. I hear you.
It's been four months
since I was with Holly

44
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,534
and she was way
hotter than Stacy.

45
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,006
So if you think
you're hurting...

46
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,542
I can't even imagine.

On Cupid's birthday?

52

Yeah.

53
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,025
She's fine.

54
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,121
So I received
my first Valentine
from a secret admirer.

"Roses are red,
violets are blue.

56

"It's time for
your dental cleaning
and maybe a checkup too."

57
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,243
Wow. Look at those.
How nice for you.

58
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,910
Up there,
front and center,
beautiful.

59
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,080
I think they would
look better right here.

60
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:13,353
They're very pretty and
I wouldn't want them to fall.

everybody in this office
is single right now.

Including me.

64
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,464
And everyone is experiencing
an incredible amount
of emotional pain.

65
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,667
Especially me,
because of my great
capacity for emotion.

66
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,277
And it is my first
Valentine's Day
since Holly,

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,538
so I think that I
am well qualified
to understand

68
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,280
that these people
need to be protected
from having love

69
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,447
shoved into their faces.

70
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,624
Pam, really? They're back?

71
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,990
I can't see them when
they're on the floor.

72
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,585
They're for her
to look at, Michael.

73
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,391
Can I have a word with you?
Yes, let's have a word.

And the sexy looks
between you and Pam,

the general sexiness,
the flowers,

79
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,307
it's creating
a bit of a hostile
work environment.

80
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,405
I understand.
It's so sexy it
becomes hostile.

81
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,212
I actually thought
we were keeping it
pretty low-key.

82

of our relationship, Michael.

179
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,657
and that other jackass
and that new jackass.

180
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,126
He's talking
about Michael,
Dwight and Andy.

181
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,186
Yeah. I understood.

182
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,757
Well, here we all are,
alone but together.

183
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,132
No flowers for us.

184
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,465
Relationships. We don't need
no stinking relationships.

185
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:35,208
I think we should all
go around and tell our
worst relationship story

186
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,475
and then get past it.

187
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,449
Just blow through it. Yeah?

188
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,782
Kelly, what about
Ryan? He treated
you pretty terribly.

189
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,412
Well, his heart was
in the right place.

190
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,821
Yeah, but now his
heart is in Thailand,

191
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,089
along with
the rest of his body,
having random sex.

192
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,729
Okay. Sorry.
Let's... Who else?

193
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:53,787
Oscar?

194
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,855
I don't think so.

195
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,232
Come on, I'm sure
there's something you
need to get off your chest.

196
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,292
Thank you.

197
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,635
You want to...
Just anything? You sure?

198
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,675
I'm sure
whatever you did
wasrt your fault.

199
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,711
Okay, well, who else?

200
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,780
Everyone here
who's bowled a 280,
please raise your hand.

201
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,839
No way.
Wow.

202
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,442
A 280?
That's impressive.

203
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,613
Okay, now everyone
here who's bowled
under 70 raise their hand.

204
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,678
Yikes.

205
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,985
Come on, Bob,
raise your hand.
No, Bob.

206
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,184
No.
What?

207
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,784
One time.
You love bringing
up that one time.

208
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,887
Yes, I do.
Jim uses a six-pound ball.

209
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,056
That is a lie.

210
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,963
Yes. He bowled five frames

211
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,367
with this pink sparkly thing
until a little girl had to
ask for her ball back.

212
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,065
But that girl must have
had monstrous hands
because the holes fit.

213
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,870
No, you just have
little dainty fingers.

214
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,411
You could always
model lady's jewelry.

215
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,843
Nobody asked, Bob.

216
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,937
(ALL LAUGHING)

217
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,647
Do you risk telling
them how you feel?

218
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:48,448
Do you say something
that you can barely
admit to yourself?

219
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,852
God, what did you do?

220
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,447
Not that I approve
of any of it, but...

221
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,550
I was stupid.
I told him.

222
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,653
Was he into you in,
like, a gay way?

223
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,631
Moron, if he was
there wouldn't be a story.

224
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,298
He told me he wasrt gay.

225
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,392
(ALL EXCLAIM SYMPATHETICALLY)

226
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,232
Really sad.
OSCAR: I'm not done yet.

227
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,293
Oh, my God.

228
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,364
A week later,
a friend of mine
calls me up

229
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,572
and he says, "I just saw him
in a gay bar in Kansas City."

230
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,145
Well, then it's
a happy ending,
because he was gay.

231
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,478
You should call him.

232
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,646
My worst breakup
was actually two breakups.
Two different men.

233
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:29,023
I was in love with
both of them and
when things went bad

234
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,426
they had a duel over me.

235
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,588
Yeah, Dwight and Andy.
We were here.

236
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,688
No.

237
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:37,498
This was years ago
when I was living in Ohio.
John Mark and John David.

238
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,974
Angela, you had
two sets of different men
actually duel over you?

239
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,437
I guess I have.

240
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,174
All right, who's next?
Where's Andy?

241
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,648
He's on one of
his honeymoons.

242
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,775
What?

243
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,049
He made nonrefundable deposits
on his honeymoons,

244
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,522
so he's just knocking
them off one at a time.

245
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,058
I think today he's
hot-air ballooning,

246
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,323
and later he's got
a couples' massage.

247
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,459
My worst breakup
was with Stacy.

248
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,592
It was a Sunday morning.
We were reading the paper

249
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:16,237
and I said, "Oh, my God,
I think the Eagles could
clinch the NFC East."

250
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,334
And she said that we're done.

251
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,947
You know what, guys, I don't
think we need to do this.

252
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,042
You're right.
Okay, everyone,
back to work.

253
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,748
No, no, no, no.
I mean have
this kind of party.

254
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,053
I look around and
I see all these
beautiful people

255
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,592
who are alone on Valentine's

256
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,323
and I think that there
are other single people
out there, too.

257
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,625
We just need to find them.

258
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,291
There's a girl out
there for all of us.

259
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,733
Maybe even in
this office park.

260
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,271
There has to be
a way to get all these
lonely people together.

261
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,566
A net? A giant net?

262
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,403
No, not a giant net.

263
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,464
What do you have in mind?

264
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,636
I was thinking
maybe like a mixer.

265
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,701
Oh, God, that's
a terrible idea.

266
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,768
Old-fashioned
meat market.

267
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:55,871
No.
I don't think it is.

268
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,145
Lonely people
mixing with one
another, breeding,

269
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,085
creating an even
lonelier generation?

270
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,884
You're not allowing
natural selection
to do its work.

271
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,824
You're like the guy
who invented the seatbelt.

272
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,222
These people need love.

273
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,129
And I am going
to get it for them.

274
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,697
Who cares if we
sell a little bit
less paper today?

275
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,894
A great boss cares more

276
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:20,962
about the happiness
of his employees
than anything else.

277
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,769
I am going to be Cupid.

278
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,141
And I'm going
to shoot my sparrow
at unsuspecting victims

279
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,978
and they are going to get hit
and say, "I'm in love.

280
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,210
"I was hit by
Cupid's sparrow."

281
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,246
Funny little bird,
but he gets the job done.

282
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,044
Hey.

283
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,886
Hey. No movement.

284
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,947
Still early.

285
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,652
Yeah, it's not that early.

286
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,688
So how are you holding up?

287
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,253
I'm okay.
I feel a little lopsided

288
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,231
because of all the blood
they took out of
my right side.

289
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,995
No, no. I meant
about being single today.

290
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,567
Meh.
Meh!

291
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,626
Exactly.

292
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,705
Here we go.
Hello.

293
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,332
MICHAEL: Hello.

294
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,069
Dwight K. Schrute.

295
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,339
Why don't you introduce me
to your little friend?
Hi. Dwight.

296
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,347
Babe alert.
Hello. I'm Michael Scott.
Welcome to our little shindig.

297
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,439
Hi. I'm Lynn.

298
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,882
Lynn, follow me.
Come on in.

299
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,940
Here we go.

300
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,919
For you we have one
of our top people,

301
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:13,357
Kevin Malone.
Kevin, come out here.
Show your beautiful self.

302
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,816
Hello.

303
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:16,884
Hi.

304
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,498
So run with the ball.
Run with it, Kev.

305
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,526
Where are you from?

306
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,593
I'm from here.

307
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,470
Yeah, okay.
Well, he only
gets better.

308
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,339
Thank you, Michael.
Okay.

309
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,641
I can untie any knot.
I'm serious.

310
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,408
Name a knot, any knot.
Go ahead.

311
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,313
I believe you.

312
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,409
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

313
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,546
In fact, there are many knots
that I cannot untie.

314
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,823
So what's a woman as
charming as yourself
find herself employed

315
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,624
on a day such as today?

316
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,756
I work at a place
that does catalogs for

317
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,597
community colleges
and small businesses.

318
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,398
You must use a lot of paper.

319
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,267
Oh, God, tons of it.

320
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,034
(SIGHS DELIGHTEDLY)

321
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,903
What's the rule
about eating

322
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,378
when people are
in the bathroom?

323
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,211
I think if you
ordered hot food
you're allowed to eat.

324
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,812
Damn.

325
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,847
They've been in there
for like ten minutes.

326
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,320
Look at that.
Bob ordered hot food.

327
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,126
Yes.

328
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,955
And I think they
gave him too many fries.

329
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,521
We should help him out.

330
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,806
At the Circle Drive-in,
they show old movies.

331
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,808
It's really cool.

332
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,435
That does sound cool.

333
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,910
I used to go there
with my fiancee.

334
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:47,317
Before she left me.
I mean, before I left her.

335
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,919
She left me.

336
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,748
Shoot.

337
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,590
I think I blew it.

338
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,789
It all happened so fast.

339
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,424
So fast.

340
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,568
So, Erik, you
mentioned before

341
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,903
that you are in
tool and die repair.

342
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,032
I am.

343
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,771
Meredith recently had
a total hysterectomy.

344
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,075
So that's sort of a repair.

345
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,713
All right,
I'll let you guys talk.

346
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,054
It's going very well.
People are mixing.
A lot of hope,

347
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,285
'cause that's
what you hate to see,
when hope gets crushed.

348
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,162
Sorry. Thought I heard
somebody coming in.

349
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,992
So, it's not too late.

350
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,925
(SIGHS)

351
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,006
DWIGHT: And the kind of
discounts we're talking
about are not...

352
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,737
Hold on. Michael,
why do you keep looking
at the front door?

353
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,278
No reason.
Is somebody after you?

354
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,335
Why do you always
go to that?

355
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,314
Has anyone ever been after
anyone in this office?

356
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,781
Hey, it just takes one.

357
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,181
Nobody's after me. I just...

358
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,152
I met a woman when
I was giving blood

359
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,744
and I thought
she might come by.

360
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,256
You met a woman when
you were giving blood?
That is so romantic.

361
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,885
It's not a big deal, really.
I just, you know,

362
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,293
met somebody.
We hardly talked.

363
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:08,561
I picked up her glove
so I was hoping I could
give it back to her.

364
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,194
Oh, my God, that makes it
even more romantic.

365
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,268
This is like
a modern-day Enchanted.
It's like a fairytale.

366
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,500
She could be
your soul mate.

367
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,700
DWIGHT: Not likely.

368
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:17,935
With three billion
women on the planet,

369
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,706
most of them live
in Asia, so the numbers
just don't add up.

370
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,803
It's possible.
Could be.

371
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,508
Believe me, it's nothing.
I hardly even talked to her.

372
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,017
We just...
We were lying there
next to each other.

373
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,020
I think our
blood bags touched.

374
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,077
Aww!

375
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,017
Here they come.
What?

376
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,356
No. Just kidding.

377
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,157
Seriously though,
that's enough.

378
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,027
Why don't you cover it
with the broccoli?

379
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
Great, I have to cover it?

380
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,693
Do you think they
dined and dashed?

381
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,433
They didn't dine so, yeah,
maybe they just dashed.

382
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,740
I thought we were
having a nice time.

383
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,902
We were.

384
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:53,967
Yeah.

385
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,311
Empty.
Mine too.

386
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,014
(MOANING)

387
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,079
Oh, boy.
Oh, my God.

388
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,284
Okay.

389
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,887
Hi. Is this the party?

390
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:13,954
Nah.

391
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,557
(ALL SIGH DISAPPOINTEDLY)

392
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,209
Okay then.

393
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,409
So...

394
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,543
Where were we?

395
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,677
Bowling.

396
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,892
Yep, yeah, yep.

397
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,492
You didn't eat
much there, Jim-bo.

398
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,760
Initially I did.

399
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,959
Want some meat?

400
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,401
Sure, a little piece.
No mushroom, though.

401
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,495
I forgot.

402
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,937
Yeah. Thank you.

403
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,912
Hey, I'm sorry we did not
have a chance to talk more.

404
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,480
I get very nervous
talking to pretty girls.

405
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,115
Seriously,
feel how sweaty my hand is.

406
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,689
That's really sweaty.

407
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,229
Are you on e-mail?

408
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,423
Yeah.

409
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,562
Cool. Okay, bye.

410
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:26,729
Bye, Kevin.

411
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,004
Good Valentine's.

412
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,137
So basically
the greater volume
you decide to buy in,

413
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,149
the greater discount
we can give you.
Okay.

414
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,479
Okay? What's up?

415
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,712
Look, I'm going to go.

416
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,187
Before you go,
I'd just love to get
a firm commitment on this.

417
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,348
You know, maybe sign...

418
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,684
Look, we already
have a paper supplier.

419
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:49,716
Okay.

420
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:54,598
Well, thanks for wasting
my time tonight, idiot. God!

421
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,264
Hey. You don't
deserve her.

422
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,831
Thanks, Michael.

423
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,308
Hey, if anybody wants to go...

424
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,980
We can stay a little longer.

425
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,416
Really?
ANGELA: Yeah.

426
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,078
MEREDITH: Yeah. Sure, Michael.
KELLY: Yeah.

427
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,816
No, this is great.
Absolutely.

428
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,982
Yeah.

429
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,489
Thanks.

430
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,512
Michael, it's time.

431
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,607
You know what?
You guys can get out.

432
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,948
I'm going to soldier
on for a little bit.

433
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,147
Come on. We'll all go.

434
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,655
Yeah.
Yeah. Let's go.

435
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,683
Okay.

436
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:59,661
MICHAEL: Four months ago,
I dated a woman named Holly,

437
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,596
and this is
actually the first time
that I've even considered

438
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,464
getting back into
that arena again.

439
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,073
You know what?
Sometimes it's not about

440
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,578
whether Cinderella
gets her slipper back,

441
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:18,947
but it's about
the fact that the prince even
picked up the slipper at all.

442
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,344
There's a lot of
princesses out there.

443
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,254
You know, they have
all different sizes

444
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,817
and shapes of
feet and hands,

445
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,922
so I think...

446
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,694
I think my odds
are pretty good.

447
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,531
Pardon me, may I have
a chocolate chip cookie?

448
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,006
I gave blood earlier
and I'm still feeling woozy.

449
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,804
Of course.

450
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,806
That's weird.
You got a cotton ball

451
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,938
and tape and we've
been using Band-Aids.

452
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:54,111
I feel so woozy, I just...
Using Band-Aids.

453
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,278
Damn.
