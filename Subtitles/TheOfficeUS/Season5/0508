1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,897
Did you know that in Morocco

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,664
it is common to
exchange a small gift

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,968
when meeting somebody
for the first time?

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,272
In Japan, you must
always commit suicide
to avoid embarrassment.

5
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:17,511
In Italy, you must
always wash your hands
after going to the bathroom.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,709
This is considered
to be polite.

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:20,980
Why are you telling us this?

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:25,388
I am jetting off
on an international
business trip.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,019
Where are you going?

10
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,355
To Canada.

11
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,452
Where is it?

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,518
Canada.
Okay.

13
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,756
My boss is
sending me abroad

14
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,562
to do a presentation to
an international client,

15
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,671
and I have always
been intrigued by
all things international,

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,832
the women, the pancakes,
the man of mystery.

17
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,840
Meredith,
I would like you to pretend
that you are from Abu Dhabi.

18
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:48,903
Hello.

19
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,280
I am ashamed
at your naked face.

20
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,249
I must cover it
with my jacket.

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,690
You are now sexy
in your culture.

22
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,318
(WHISTLING)

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,854
T-minus...

24
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,225
6.5 days.

25
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,897
(WHISPERING)
One more week.

26
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,004
Pam comes back from
New York next week,

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,708
and everyone here
has just been
so excited for me

28
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,310
and involved
and intrusive and weird.

29
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,818
One more week.

30
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,019
(CHUCKLES)

31
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,188
DAVID ON PHONE:
Do you have your passport?

32
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,288
I have my passport.

33
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,389
Got your per diem?

34
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,058
I have my per diem.

35
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,137
I already know
what I am going
to spend this on.

36
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,672
I'm going to buy a sweater.

37
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,332
Michael,
that's for your food.

38
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,774
Well, I'll just...
I'll use different
money for that.

39
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,538
I was happy to send
Michael on this trip.

40
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,446
He's been feeling
pretty down since we
had to transfer Holly

41
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,677
up to New Hampshire, and...

42
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,209
But this little perk
really seemed
to turn him around,

43
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,755
and it's pretty tough
to find somebody

44
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,657
who wants to go up
to Winnipeg mid-November.

45
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:46,292
And business-class air,
like a five-star hotel
in the sky.

46
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,526
Nothing but the best.
Actually better
than a five-star hotel

47
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,536
'cause you get a big,
cushy seat

48
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,504
and you sit in
a row of people

49
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,837
and to eat whatever
the mind can imagine.

50
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,347
I think I am going to have
a fillet with mushroom sauce.

51
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,778
Well, I'm just glad
you're happy

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,942
because, you know,
I felt bad.

53
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,986
Well, that is all in the past.

54
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:11,319
And in terms of nightlife,
when you get there,
just ask the concierge.

55
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,119
They have one of those?

56
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,025
Let's do this!

57
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,357
Wait, why do you
need three suitcases?

58
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,330
Two are empty.
For souvenirs.

59
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,388
You have your money belt?

60
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,455
I do.
It is right here.

61
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,558
Oh, no, no, no, no.

62
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,229
You wanna wear that puppy
right up on the breastbone
like a bra.

63
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,273
No, I don't wanna
wear a bra.
Here, let me help you.

64
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,398
Stop it! Stop it!

65
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,374
Do you want to get robbed
in a foreign country?

66
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,467
I wash my hands of this.

67
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,977
Okay, where's
my translator?

68
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,638
Ici, monsieur.
MICHAEL: There he is.

69
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,151
I'm just bidding
a bon voyage a la
mon petite fiancee.

70
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,121
Translation,
goodbye my petite fiancee.

71
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,849
Be good.
I will try.

72
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:46,949
Meaning what?

73
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,756
Meaning I will try to
get other dudes laid.

74
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,558
Yeah, baby.
That's what I'm
talking about.

75
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,690
That could be you
if you hadrt
forgotten French.

76
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,563
Where is my numbers man?

77
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,659
Here.

78
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,034
MICHAEL: There we go!
Our town car awaits.

79
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,094
It's just a van.

80
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,367
It's not just a van.

81
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,102
Look, I know
my way around a van.

82
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,803
That is just a van.

83
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,478
Dwight, can you
get those, please?

84
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,218
Welcome to Cribs,
the business-class
edition.

85
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,982
Check this out. Mimosa.

86
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,717
Sweet.
Handed it to me
as I sat down.

87
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,689
This was my hot towel.
It is still wet.

88
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,062
Michael G. Scott
rolling like a pimp.

89
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,859
Take a sip of that.
Mmm-hmm.

90
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,092
Is that good?

91
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,726
Mmm!
Don't drink all of it.
Give some to Oscar.

92
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,826
That's really good.
I'm good.

93
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,495
You want one of your own?
I can hook you up.

94
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,698
I'm sorry,
you'll need to
keep moving.

95
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:38,870
Yes, this is Beth.
This is my personal
valetlflight attendant,

96
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,673
and she will be
helping me this morning.

97
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,112
We need to keep
the aisle clear.

98
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,843
Yes. Get back.
Get back.
Oh. All right.

99
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,044
Come on.
Get back to the slums.
Here we go.

100

ANDY: Oh, boy.

101
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,851
(WHISPERING)
You guys, check it out.

102
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,086
My own personal
DVD player
and 20 movies.

103
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,660
(WHISPERING)
Andy brought one, too.

104
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,752
Harry and the Hendersons.

(SHUSHES)

106
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,464
Keep it down.

107
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,032
I made egg-salad sandwiches.
Do you want one?

108
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,298
Could you have
picked something stinkier
to bring on a plane?

109
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,771
(SCOFFS)
My God, Oscar, really.

110
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,638
Do you have a bag
of baby poop in there, too,
to share with everybody?

111
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,405
No, I'll be ordering
my own food.

112
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,105
Thank you very much. Hi.

113
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,169
STEWARDESS: Hi.

114
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,647
I'd like to see a menu,
please.

115
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,152
Oh, I'm sorry, there are
no meals on flights
less than two hours.

116
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,311
Okay.

117
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,886
Doesrt matter because I'm
going to take a nap.

118
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:34,232
I think I'm going to use
my complimentary blindfold.

119
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:39,501
I will don it and... Oh.

120
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,368
Look at that,

121
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,909
I can't see
because I am in...

122
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,443
(CRASHING)
God!

123
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,342
And what would
you like to drink?

124
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,747
Just checking out
where I'm gonna be
pretty soon

125
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,582
when Pam gets back.

126
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,916
It's gonna be
close quarters.

127
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,923
Gonna be a lot of tension.

128
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,516
For you. I'm with Darryl.

129
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:06,393
This looks like where
I'll probably do
my pushups every day.

130
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,068
Is that supposed
to impress me?

131
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,708
No, not gonna happen.

132
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,044
He has hurt me
too much and too often,

133
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,107
and I am in
a healthy relationship now,

134
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,846
so I'm not
going to flaunt it,
I'm not going to hurt him,

135
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,945
but that door is closed.

136
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,216
What are we doing?
This is so wrong!

137
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,589
Yeah.

138
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,724
This is nice.
This is nice.

139
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,732
Move in here.
Very sweet.

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,736
I'll check us in.

00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,365
Very cool.
Very cool.

143
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,433
We are going to find out
where the action is,
my friend.

144
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,240
Okay.
Where's the concierge?

145
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,803
Yes, Wallace said
there would be
one of those.

146
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,076
Bingo.

147
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,181
Follow moi, bro-sieur.

148
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,687
Wow.

149
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,416
What about
a nice sushi place?

150
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,014
Maybe a place
with a view?

151
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,060
Oh. Matsuki.
It's a good one.

152
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,720
You may walk there
if you wish,

153
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,895
or you may take
the number 17 bus
until 9:00.

154
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,067
Other than that,
you can take the taxi,

155
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,731
and the number
is right there.

156
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,739
Wow. Wow,
I'm blown away
by this.

157
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,778
I...

158
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,639
This is great.
Thank you.

159
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,873
One final question.

160
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,648
Where might you find
yourself on a Winnipeg
night like tonight?

161
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,315
Oh. The Huntsman is good.

162
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,380
The Huntsman?

163
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,689
Down here,
the financial district.

164
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,955
A concierge is
the Winnipeg equivalent
of a geisha.

165
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,500
This is a woman
who has been

166
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,968
trained in the fine art
of fanciness and pleasure,

167
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,598
and when you meet one,
it is intoxicating.

168
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,366
Just what
the doctor ordered.

169
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,907
I can't believe this.

170
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,977

171
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,175
Are you sure?

00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,652
PAM: I just talked
to my advisor. Failing.

173
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,115
Wow. I thought you
were good at Flash.

00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,190
I was. And then they
switched to Acrobat
just as I was learning Quark.

175
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,853
I hate computers.

176
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,022
Okay, okay,
it's no big deal.

177
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,395
So you're not
a computer geek.

178
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,661
I have to stay and retake it.

179
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,970
Wow. Um...

180
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,232
Well, okay.

181
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,903
That means
another 12 weeks.

182
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,974
Can you do another
three months of this?

183
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,441
It's not...
It's not about me.

184
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,486
I mean, this is your dream.

185
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,516
And you went to
New York to do this.

186
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:49,992
So when you come back,
you come back
the right way, right?

187
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,291
Right.

188
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,229
You okay?

189
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,404
My cell battery's low,
so I have to let you go.

190
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,738
Okay. All right.
All right.

191
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,797
Love you. Bye.

192
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,036
Love you, too.

Guys. She's in there.

00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,228
I'm probably going to
leave after one drink.
Let's do this.

Yeah, with a hot slab
of Canadian bacon
in your hand.

Excuse me. Hello.
Concierge Marie.
Michael Scott.

Good to see you again.

Hello. Good to see you.

This is my associate
from Dunder Mifflin,

Nice to meet you.
Oscar.

Works in accounting.

205
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:54,016
This is Concierge Marie,
who works at our hotel.

206
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,852
You look,
how you say,
radiant tonight.

207
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,990
Thank you.

208
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,365
And it is, how you say,
a beautiful night.

209
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,829
Michael, why?

210
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,736
She's foreign. I...

211
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,470
For madame et monsieur.

212
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,909
Thank you.

213
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,173
You're very welcome.

214
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,270
Thank you, Andy.

215
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,406
Thank you.

216

Let me get
a picture of you guys.

MICHAEL: Everybody's
going to end up
dying some day,

218
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,482
and I think
it's better to die

219
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,716
with some people
that you like,

220
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,290
like Oscar and Andy
and Concierge Marie,

221
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,052
than to know that
there's somebody
out there

222
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,394
that you love
that you're not with.

223
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,303
All right,
I've scoped out
the joint.

224
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,169
Those two dudes
are as good as naked.

225

How do you even
know they're gay?

Mademoiselle, beer me deux

s'il vous plait.

228
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,089
Bad decision in a glass.

229
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,025
I don't care
if you're gay,
straight, engaged,

230
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,995
whatever,
a guy needs intercourse.

231
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,297

when they spank thee.

Don't do this.

What?

235
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,101
Do you like apples?

236
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,368
Sorry, what?

237
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,637
How do you like
these apples?

238
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,603
All right,
on a scale of one to 10,

239
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,680
how hot is that dude?

240
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,553
Is he your boyfriend
or something?

241
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:34,259
No, but he could be yours
if you play your cards right.

242
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,393
Dude, leave us alone,
all right?

243
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,896
Gentlemen.

244
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,467
What are you doing?
Dude, you struck out.

245
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,337
They're totally stuck up.
Here. Drink up.

246
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,773
How about this one.
It's Christmas Eve...
Mmm-hmm.

247
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,812
...and everything is closed
and you need to get
some dry-cleaning done.

248
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,747
12:00, midnight,
where do you go?

249
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,183
What do you do?

250
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,620
What do you do?
Come on, what do you do?

251
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,816
Uh... Astro Cleaners
on St. James Place

252
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,518
is the only place
that is open
on that day.

253
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,652
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

254
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,253
If you don't
mind me asking...

255
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,855
Anything.
You can ask me anything.

Okay.

sat next to Angela

for a very long,
very long time.

Right-oh.

260
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,703
How could anyone
stand that woman?

261
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,040
What?
What do you see in her?

262
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,943
What do you see in Angela?
What do I see in Angela?

263
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,537
I wanna know.

264
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:34,551
I see through a hard exterior
to a little jelly
in the middle.

265
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,551
She is teaching me
to be a better person.

266
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,992
She's working
really hard on that.

267
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,187
AND Y: And she has
the softest skin
I've ever seen,

268
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,130
and I can't wait to
have sex with her.

269

OSCAR: You haven't had sex?

270
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,792
No.

Are you guys waiting
to get married? Or...

272
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,340
Honestly, I don't know
what we're waiting for.

273
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,669
Andy, something is
wrong with that woman.

274
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:57,936
What is wrong with her?

275
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,671
I'd like to know.
You should call
her and ask her.

276
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,905
I'd like to know
what's wrong with her.

277
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,574
I should call
her and ask her.
What is wrong with her?

278
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,174
Do it. It's a...
Call her.

279
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,983
Oh, my God,
don't call her.
Don't call her, Andy.

00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,454
Andy! Oh, my God!
It's too late.

281
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,219
It's too late.
It's dialing.

282
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,021

What is wrong with you?

286

Why won't you do Andy?

287
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,627
What?
That's Oscar,

288
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,066
and he wants to know
why you won't do me,

289
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,467
and I think it's
a valid question.

290

you to sex school.

Who is that, monkey?

What?

301
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,218
We'll discuss it later naked.

302

I wanna see you naked.

get some breakfast
or something?

from two different directions.

grab a cup of coffee.

in the parking lot.

Hey.

we called her up
last night.

We called Angela?

335
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,354
You... You called her.

336
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,863
That was real?

337
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,534
I thought I dreamed that.

Oh, God. Oh, God!
All right.

00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,072
Okay.
This is so bad.

for the meeting?

This has to happen again.

345
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,476
Darryl can't
happen again.
Look at me.

346
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,953
Do you want me to
do more pushups?
Yeah.

347
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,716
Okay. You have to
break up with Darryl.

348
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,654
I already typed out
a text message for you.

349
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,853
All you have to do
is press send.

350
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,364
I don't know.
I mean, it's well-written
and all, I just...

351
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,265
Has to be done.
We'll press send
together.

352
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,127
(BEEPS)

353
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,236
Oh, my God,
he's gonna kill us.

354
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,637
I'd like to see him try.

355
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,737
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

356
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,369
Oh.

357
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,311
He says it's cool.
He said it's cool!

358
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,439
That's all he wrote?

359
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,506
That's all he wrote.

360
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,348
Can I see it?
Mmm-hmm.

361
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,889
Didrt you two date for,
like, a long time?

362
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,585
Mmm-hmm.
This is like a fairytale.

363
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,530
(ALARM DEACTIVATES)

364
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,303
I'll be honest with you.
We've been talking
with Catalyst Paper.

365
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,206
Their prices are
better than yours.

366
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,177
Look, people continue
to come back to us
time and time again

367
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,646
because they feel
cared for here.

368
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:01,742
They feel respected,
and they feel that
their needs matter.

369
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:06,123
They are treated
like human beings.

370
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,495
MAN: Everything okay?
Yes.

371
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,697
Oh, man,
she is so pissed.

372
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,931
She's taking us
back to first base.

373
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,769
What's first base
with Angela?

374
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,602
I get to kiss
her forehead.

375
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,512
I had a good time
hanging out this weekend.

376
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,483
I had a good time, too.

377
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,155
Wingman for life. W-M-F-L.

378
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,450
Thank you.

379
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,583
You up for a chest bump?

380
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,683
No.

381
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,089
Bro hug?

382
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,694
Back to basics. I like it.

383
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,034
I had to go
all the way to Canada

384
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,371
to get to know
a guy who sits
20 feet away from me.

385
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,739
And he's delightful.

386
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,711
DAVID ON PHONE:
Hey, I just heard
you guys made the sale.

387
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,381
MICHAEL: Yeah, we locked
him up for two years.

388
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,782
Good. Very good!

389
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,946
See? I told you.
Sounds like somebody
had a good trip.

390
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,990
No, actually,
the trip sucked.

391
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,082
Excuse me?

392
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,753
The trip sucked, David.

393
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,160
It blew chunks.

394
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,790
It was terrible.
It was a bad trip.

395
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,891
I did not like the trip.
What are you talking about?

396
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,766
Well, starting with
the airport shuttle,

397
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,773
which was
basically just a van,

398
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,336
and business class...
Okay.

399
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,843
...which was
basically just coach,

400
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,439
and the hotel,
which sucked big time.

401
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,572
The hotel. What...

402
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,808
It was not...
It sucked.
Okay.

403
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,941
I'm sorry to hear
the hotel was bad.

404
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,041
The Crestmore...

405
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,111
And thanks for
the tip on the concierge.
That was great.

406
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,485
That was great.
That was a...

407
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,580
Okay.

408
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,749
...that was
a really good choice.

409
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,849
Hey, hey, hey. Michael.

410
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,120
Please listen for a second.

411
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,560
No, David, you listen to me.

412
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,295
Why'd you send her away?
That...

413
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:01,869
God. You knew I liked her
and you just sent
her away, and that...

414
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,367
That was a sucky
thing to do, man.
Michael.

415
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,343
That was a really
sucky thing to do.

416
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,140
Sometimes... Sometimes...

417
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,441
MICHAEL: Why have I stayed
at Dunder Mifflin for so long?

418
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,044
Certainly not
because of the paycheck

419
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,816
'cause I could be
making more money
as a doctor

420
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,085
or a professional athlete.

421
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,753
I think it's
because they respect me.

422
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,157
A boss that will not fire you

423
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,791
even though you
just tell him off

424
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,131
right to his face
over the phone,

425
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,094
that's respect.

426
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,035
You did it, man.
Day one.

427
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,511
Congrats.

428
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,943
Thanks, man.

429
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,454
I'm coming back
the wrong way.

430
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,753
It's not because of you.

431
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,128
I don't like graphic design.
That's it.

432
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,635
Stop smiling.
I really didn't like it.

433
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,173
It's just designing
logos and stuff,
and I miss Scranton,

434
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,343
but it is not
because I missed you.

435
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,175
I just really
wanted to come home.

436
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,311
And I know you said
to come home the right way,

437
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,784
but you can't tell me
what to do. Got it?

438
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,445
I missed you.

439
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,251
I missed you, too.

440
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,794
You're back.

441
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:31,886
Yeah.

442
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,056
Good.

443
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,430
I need you to make
five copies of these.

444
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,298
I'm not going inside.

445
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,032
All right. First thing
in the morning, then.

446
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,476
Welcome back.

447
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,579
We're back
together again, baby.

448
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,672
We're back.

449
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,774
They tried
to keep us apart,
but they couldn't.

450
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,546
It was like destiny.

451
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,746
I realized that,
for whatever reason,

452
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,256
I just couldn't do
better than Kelly.

453
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,586
Aw!

454
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,683
Yeah.
