00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,367
KEVIN: At least once a year,

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:06,769
I like to bring in
some of my Kevirs
Famous Chili.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,936
The trick is to
undercook the onions.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,845
Everybody is going
to get to know each
other in the pot.

5
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,576
Now, I'm serious
about this stuff.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,610
I'm up the night before,
pressing garlic and
dicing whole tomatoes.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,749
I toast my own
Ancho chilies.

is returning.

14

He started his own
company, and now
he's back.

15
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,562
Who could it be?

16
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,197
I'll give you a hint.
He is a man.

17
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,209
A man you have missed
with all your heart.

18
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,678
A man who has ruined
all other men for you.

19

25
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,465
Well, I guess
the first order
of business

26
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,201
is to welcome back
me and Pam and Ryan.

again, huh? Reinstituting

You all look great.

30

What I want to do right
now is try something
a little different.

31
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,388
I'm going to throw it
out there, starting
with this meeting.

I want you guys to
run it. I want you to
say whatever you want.

(STAMMERING)
What are you doing?

00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,836
If there is something
that you would like
to say as a group,

36
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,101
then by all means,
you may say it
to me right now.

37
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,504
Okay.
MICHAEL: Yes.

Take it up with Toby.
What I want you to do

40
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,173
is I want you
to look inward,

41
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,946
and I want you to reflect,
and I want you to say
something different.

42
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,384
Can you give us a hint?

43
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,019
MICHAEL: When I needed
salespeople for my new
paper company,

44
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,719
everyone here turned
their back on me.

45
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,189
Am I going to ask them
to beg for forgiveness?
No.

46
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:50,430
Am I going to ask for
a big, crying apology?
No.

47
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,098
(LAUGHS) Am I going to
ask them to slit their
wrists for me? No.

48
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,008
I just want a tiny,
microscopic version
of that.

49
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,009
Oscar, what were
you going to say?

50
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,639
Nothing. I didn't
say anything.

51
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:03,773
All right.

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,284
Do I still have
a job here?
Not important.

53

Okay.

She deserves to know.
You have a job.

56
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,786
Frankly, you have
a job because
Ryan and Pam

57
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,126
are starting with us
as salesmen.

58
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,325
Wait, what?
How is that
going to work?

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,890
MICHAEL: It's going
to work very smoothly

60
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,526
because Pam and Ryan
are bringing over

61
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,504
a ton of clients
from Michael Scott
Paper Company and...

62
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,200
You mean the clients
you stole from us.

63
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,832
Yeah, aren't we
getting those
clients back?

64
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,706
No, you lost
those clients.

Okay.

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,940
DWIGHT: You were bought out.
They...

67
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,245
So the company, then,
bought out all of
the stolen clients.

68
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,786
Okay, Dwight,
let me explain
something to you.

69
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,949
I set the rules,
and you follow
them blindly, okay?

70
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,515

a problem with that,

71

then you can talk to
our complaint department.

more time to talk

Isn't that what you said
to a bunch of my clients
when you were stealing them?

That I didn't have
enough time for them?

Jeez, what...
What are you
doing here?

147
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,694
I don't know. I saw
a crowd. Thought there
might be a dog fight or...

do something.

or we take Ryan hostage.

No, I'm not saying
we do those things.

153

I'm saying something
like those things.

154
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,012
Of course.
What is like a hostage?

155
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,346
Excellent question.

156
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,512
We could write
a strongly worded
letter.

be enough.

No, pictures are
too interpretive.

Can I just say something?
I know that tempers are high.

But I think the best
way to handle this

161

might be to just talk
to Michael directly.

That one's great.
I know.

170
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,483
PAM: Why are you so mad?
RYAN: You look so classy.

171
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,749
MICHAEL: I do? Well...

172
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,846
(PAM LAUGHING)

173
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,482
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Where is that bowl?

174
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,551
Hi, you have a second?
Michael Scott
Paper Company only.

175
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,256
Yeah, I think you're
gonna wanna cool it
with that,

176
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,094
'cause it's starting to
upset the other salesmen.

177
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,292
Okay, well...
Tough.

178
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,232
I will... No. No.

179
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,167
I'll talk to them
when they all get back
from the bathroom.

180
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,866
This is awkward to talk
about, but there
may or may not be,

181
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,000
but definitely is,
a mutiny forming in
the warehouse right now.

182
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,539
Against who?
You.

183
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,475
Us.
What?

184
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,482
It's gotta be
because they all
want their clients...

185
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,882
The old Michael Scott
might have taken this,

186
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,977
but not the new
Michael Scott.

187
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:46,889
They are in for a bitter
surprise. I am not to be
truffled with.

188
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,126
Six weeks ago,
none of these people
wanted to come with me.

189
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,462
You two were the only ones
with the stones to follow.

190
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,558
Mmm-hmm.

191
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,433
That was us,
right there.
PAM: We were something else.

192
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,837
What you gotta do is
you gotta go down
to that warehouse

193
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,502
and you gotta crack some
skulls, Chiklis style.
MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm.

194
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,408
Yeah, The Commish.

195
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,141
Yes, but Chiklis
Shield style...
Okay.

196
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,513
...not Commish style.
Yeah, yeah. The Shield.

197
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,723
It's crazy, what's going
on out there today, huh?

198
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,691
(CHUCKLES)
I know. Yeah,
it's kinda...

199
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,955
Sometimes it's best
just to stay out of it.

200
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,688
That's true.
That's right, yeah.

201
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,960
Want to play a game?

202
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,931
Hey, gang,
where you been?

203
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,467
Lunch.

204
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,705
Where'd you eat?
A restaurant.

205
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,179
What did you
have, Stanley?

206
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,046
I had a salmon salad
with water, no ice.

207
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,551
I was going to get
a soda, but the waitress
talked me out of it.

208
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,087
Her name was Flo.
She had black hair.

209
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,213
I had Mexican food.

210
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,483
So since you
guys already ate,

211
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,288
you won't be eating the stuff
that you brought with you for
lunch, will you?

212
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,033
(EXCLAIMING)

213
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,003
Wow, Stanley,
is that egg salad?

214
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,664
Andy brought
some salmon.

215
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,866
RYAN: That looks great.

216
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,671
Dwight, is that
a meat sandwich?

217
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,644
You guys hungry?
I can eat.

218
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,307
I'm going to have
some of this
meat sandwich.

219
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,408
It's pony.

220
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,186
Mmm!
What kind of sauce
is on your salmon?

221
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,778
(EXCLAIMING)
ANDY: Dijonnaise.

222
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,719
MICHAEL: Thanks for
going out, guys.
PAM: Mmm-hmm.

223
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,226
Hey, Meredith, can
I talk to you privately
for a second?

224
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,593
About what?
Your outfit.

225
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,723
What? What's wrong
with my outfit?

226
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,567
(STAMMERING) You might
consider pulling it
down a touch.

227
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,401
It's riding up
a little high.

228
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,135
Bunch of prudes.
You know, Oscar's
allowed to wear sandals,

229
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,972
(ALL GASPING)
But I'm not allowed to
wear open-toed shoes?

230
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,511
Is that how it goes?

231
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,978
Meredith, your boob is out.

232
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,036
Fine.

Too far, Meredith!
Too far!

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,781
Damn it, Meredith,
where are your
panties?

235
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,444
It's casual day.

236
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,216
Happy?

OSCAR: Toby?

240
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,897
No. If you do that,
I'm going to do that.

241
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,595
If you do that,
I'm going to do that.

242
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,570
If you do this,
I'm going to do that.

243
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,466
What if I just do this?

244
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,202
You don't want
to do that.

245
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,144
I'm just hiding out
until all this
stuff blows over,

246
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,671
with Creed, playing
chess, at work.

I feel like
I'm describing
a dream I had.

RYAN: I'm sorry you feel
that way, Mr. Bart.

250
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,124
Is there anything I can do
to make things better?

Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

first complaint in 10 years...
That's my client.

...things have
been generally good.

...at these prices,
with this service...
Hey, it's Dwight here!

going to find this
anywhere else.

are tough right now,

you lost that account!

He was my client
for 10 years!

268
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,259
You made him lose
the account by screaming
at him the entire time!

It's okay, Ryan.

270
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,092
You're a secretary!
What do you know?

271
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,135
And you're a temp!
And I'm taking your phone.

272

I'm confiscating this!
Hey, guys...

273
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,106
You know what I want
you to do? Shake hands,
get over it.

274
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,776
That was not
a shake, Dwight.

275
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,145
We want our clients back
or we quit, Michael.

276
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,581
Who quits?

277
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,543
Me.

278
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,745
And me.
Me, too.

279
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:36,845
You guys gotta be kidding.

280
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,446
No, we gotta be
deadly serious.

281
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,151
We'll start our
own paper company.

282
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:45,186
The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-
Vance-Stanley Paper Company.

283
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,756
I love it!
I love this idea,
and I fully support you.

284
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,326
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to give
you some seed money.

285
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,736
There you go.
There's some
seed money for you.

286
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,672
And you can take it,
no hard feelings,

287
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,233
but if you stay,
I want an apology,

288
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,369
and I want a big one.

289
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,846
You want us to
apologize to you?
Yes, I do.

290
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,439
That's completely backwards.

291
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,677
It's frontwards!

292
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,742
Michael, you thought
you were attacking
Corporate,

293
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,219
but we were the
ones who got hurt.

294
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,619
You should be
apologizing to us.

295
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,781
ALL: That's right.

296
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:16,817
Michael, you always
said we were a family.
Then you went after us.

297
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,067
No matter how I look at
this, I am in the wrong.

298
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,001
And I have looked
at this thing like
100 different ways,

299
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:31,406
from my point of view,
from their point of view,

300
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:38,376
98 others, and bottom
line, I am in the wrong.

301
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,747
I'm the bad guy.

302
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,781
I need you
to arrange a meeting

303
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,585
between me and
the sales staff

304
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,888
without Ryan
and Pam knowing.

305
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,291
Gasp.

306
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,522
Are you talking
about a secret meeting?

307
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,656
(WHISPERING)
Whatever you guys
did earlier.

308
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,326
I don't know
the first thing about
secret meetings.

309
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,337
Just do it, okay?
Get them there.
Get them there.

310
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,702
I'll do the best
I can, Michael.

311
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,831
Are you kidding me?

312
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,603
Deceit does not
come easy to me.
Okay, okay, okay.

313
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,383
I really love
your outfit.

314
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,047
Thank you so much
for saying that.

315
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,421
I can't believe
that Toby thinks
this is inappropriate.

316
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,857
You look like J-Lo.

317
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,455
So, from the bottom
of my heart

318
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,192
to the top of
my heart, I am sorry.

319
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,893
Are you giving us
our clients back?

320
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,334
If we could just focus
and go down the line,

321
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,065
and everyone would say,
"Apology accepted,"

322
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,629
I think we would
all feel better,

323
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,508
and then we can break
out my gift to you,

324
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,705
complimentary
white chocolate bark.

325
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,748
Nobody likes that stuff,
except for you.

326
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,807
They wouldn't make it
unless people liked it.

327
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,319
Michael, just give
us our clients back.
That's all we care about.

328
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,252
Okay, if I give you
your clients back,

329
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,415
there won't be enough
clients for Pam and Ryan,

330
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,652
and I promised both of
them that they were
going to be salespeople.

331
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,957
So?
Fine, have your clients.

332
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,554
I can see that's what
you wanted all along.
ALL: Okay.

333
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,361
MICHAEL: However,
I rescind my apology.

334
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,525
ANDY: That's fair.
STANLEY: Absolutely.

335
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,126
You are not reacting
at all as I had hoped.

(MACHINE WHIRRING)

337
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,006
What did I tell you
about building forts
in my warehouse?

338
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,415
RYAN: Michael gave all
of our clients back to
their old salespeople.

339
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,750
So now there's not enough
for both me and Pam
to stay on.

340
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,051
PAM: He can only
keep one of us as
a salesperson now.

341
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,819
He'll make his decision
by the end of the day.

342
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,325
I think you
should get it.

343
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,685
You really
grew into it.

344
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,090
Oh.

345
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,132
I think you
should get it.

346
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,599
You've changed a lot,
and you'd be good at it.

347
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,170
If you really think
that, will you tell
that to Michael?

348
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,730
That would go a long
way, coming from you.

349
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:43,968
Yeah.

So, hey, I want to set
you up with my daughter.

Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.

353
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,041
I thought you were gay.

354
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,518
(CLICKS TONGUE) Then why
would you want to set me
up with your daughter?

to you for a minute?

I need your help.

361
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,527
This whole Pam-Ryan debate
is screwing with my head.

362
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,369
Well, I don't want to be
biased, but I am very close
to Ryan. You know that.

363
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,739
You're close
with Pam, too.

I guess.

366
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,580
Pro for Ryan, he went
to business school.
He's my number-one choice.

367
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,209
Well, that's...
I like his hair.

368
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,483
Cons, Ryan, he
defrauded the company.

369
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,183
He has never
made a sale.
Okay.

370
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,315
He definitely
stole my iPod.

371
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,825
That sounds pretty biased.

372
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,155
You didn't
hear my pros.

'cause his mom drives him
to work every day.

374
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,661
Okay. Pam, pros,
I like her.
Mmm-hmm.

375
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,931
I think that she
is a fast learner.

376
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,699
Cons, she doesn't
always follow through.

377

379
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,799
She has a weird voice.
That's not true.

380
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:52,969
I don't need to
tell you that.

381
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,570
I think she'd be
a really good
salesperson.

382
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,343
I don't think you're being
totally impartial, though,

383
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,408
because you haven't said
one bad thing about Pam.

384
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,010
And I won't.
Okay.

385
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,251
So be it. Then you've
lost credibility,

386
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,917
and I'm going to
go with my gut,
and that's Ryan.

387
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,118
Okay.

388
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,955
You're right. Sometimes,
when she is tired,

389
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,429
she can be
a little bit shrill,

390
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,591
but that's not
a weird voice,
that's just...

around to seeing

would call a classic
difficult decision.
